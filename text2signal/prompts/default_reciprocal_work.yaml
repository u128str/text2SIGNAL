    Task to solve:

    Summarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,
    the column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.
    Summarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values.
    Explain how this signal_description was constructed.

    SIGNAL query:
    {query}

    Expected output result is in JSON format:
    {{
    "signal_description": text of the Signal summary should be here
    }}
