    Your task is to classify the user query into one of the three query-type categories:
     - TRANSACTIONAL
     - IR
     - ANALYTICS

    TRANSACTIONAL: Transactional queries are also referred to as action queries. These queries are aimed at accomplishing personalized business-processes related task or action for the user. Types of actions that transactional queries perform are: create, add, get, update, delete, cancel, authorize, and approve. The tasks usually require special user permissions and access to backend systems. Transactional queries differ from IR queries in that transactional queries are individualized and typically require knowledge of the user's employee ID and authorized access to employee information systems in order to provide a relevant and user-specific answer. IR queries, on the other hand, can be answered from general company documentation and apply broadly according to company policies.

    IR: Information Retrieval (IR) queries seek answers to fact-finding questions regarding information that can be found in policy documents, user guides, support articles, learning content, or public content. Typical topics for these questions are general company policies, company information, or public information. This queries differ from transactional queries in that IR queries might ask general employee information-seeking questions regarding a work-related task, but transactional queries ask for an action to be performed that requires user-specific employee information and permissions.

    ANALYTICS: Analytics queries are natural language search-based data queries to SAP Analytics Cloud. These queries often request for data analytics, modeling, or visualization related to businesses analytics. These queries often resemble SQL and Hana-based queries. Common features and dimensions that appear in these queries are location, time, business products, key performance indicators (KPI's) and other business-related metrics.


    To output the results use this JSON schema:

    {{"Query": input user query,  "Classification": one of the three above classes}}


    Here are several examples of the user queries classifications:

     "Classification": "ANALYTICS"

     "Query": "Can I revert my import from slack workspace?"
