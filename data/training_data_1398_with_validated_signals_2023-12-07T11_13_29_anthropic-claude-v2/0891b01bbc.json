The FROM clause indicates the table being queried is \"defaultview-404\".\n\n2. The first subquery in the SELECT clause counts distinct \"Product ID\" values meeting certain criteria. The criteria are summed up in plain language. \n\n3. The second subquery counts distinct \"Product ID\" values meeting different criteria, again summarized.\n\n4. The division and multiplication operations are explained in sequential steps.\n\nSo in essence, I parsed the SIGNAL syntax, identified the key elements like table name, column names, filter conditions, and mathematical operations, and converted them to a human-readable set of instructions that someone familiar with the schema could understand.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER(\n\tWHERE (\n\t\tSELECT SUM(\"Recommended Safety Stock\") = 0\n\t)\n\tAND \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n)\n/\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
