The main components I identified were:\n\n- The SELECT clause calculates a percentage by dividing two counts and multiplying by 100. \n\n- The two COUNT aggregates with FILTER clauses define the two counts being divided:\n  - The numerator counts case_id values where 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is NULL and 'Last Invoice Due Date' is before today.\n  - The denominator counts case_id values where 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is NULL.\n  \n- The FROM clause specifies the table being queried is 'defaultview-545'.\n\nWith this understanding, I translated the query logic into a human-readable set of instructions that explicitly mentions the table name, column names, and column values/conditions used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL AND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()))\n\t)\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL)\n\t)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
