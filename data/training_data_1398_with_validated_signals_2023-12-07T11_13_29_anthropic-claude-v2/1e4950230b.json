I noted the table name, column names, and any literal values referenced. I summarized the main operations in plain language - selecting columns, case conversion, filtering, aggregation, aliases, and sorting. I explicitly called out the table and column names used. For the CASE, I explained it is mapping currency codes to names. For the filter and order by, I noted which columns were referenced.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    CASE\n\t\tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'ZAR' THEN 'South African Rand'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'AED' THEN 'United Arab Emirates Dirham'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'HKD' THEN 'Hong Kong Dollar'\n\t\tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'RUB' THEN 'Russian Ruble'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'DKK' THEN 'Danish Krone'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'SEK' THEN 'Swedish Krona'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'CHF' THEN 'Swiss Franc'\n    \tWHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'BRL' THEN 'Brazilian Real'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'GBP' THEN 'GB Pound Sterling'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'AUD' THEN 'Australian Dollar'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'JPY' THEN 'Japanese Yen'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'MZN' THEN 'Mozambican Metical'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'CAD' THEN 'Canadian Dollar'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'CLP' THEN 'Chilean Peso'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'EUR' THEN 'Euro'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'INR' THEN 'Indian Rupee'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'SGD' THEN 'Singapore Dollar'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'NGN' THEN 'Nigerian Naira'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'TWD' THEN 'Taiwan Dollar'\n        WHEN \"PO Currency\" = 'USD' OR \"PO Currency\" = 'USS' THEN 'US Dollar'\n        ELSE 'Unmapped Currenc(ies)'\n    END AS \"Currency\",\n\tROUND(SUM(\"PO Item Total Amount\")) AS \"PO Item Total Amount\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \nWHERE \"PO Currency\" IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY 2 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
