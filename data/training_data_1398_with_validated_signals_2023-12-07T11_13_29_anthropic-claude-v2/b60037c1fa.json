Flatten the 'defaultview-124' table to get 3 columns\n2. Create a new column CHANGES based on a condition on EVENT_NAME\n3. Aggregate to count unique CASE_ID and CASE_ID where CHANGES = 1, grouped by 'PO Type' \n4. Sort and limit the results\n\nI then described each logical step in plain English, referring to the specific table name, column names, and values used in the query.
