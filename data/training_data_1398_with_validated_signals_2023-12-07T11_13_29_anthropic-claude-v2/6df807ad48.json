The subquery calculates the time difference between two events - 'Create Invoice' and 'Clear Invoice'. \n\nThe outer query takes the average of these time differences. I then explicitly mentioned the table name 'defaultview-59', the two event names, and described the logic of taking the last end time of 'Create Invoice' and subtracting the first end time of 'Clear Invoice'.\n\nThis summarizes the key information in the query - the table, columns, values, and logic - in a human-readable format.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Create Invoice'))))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
