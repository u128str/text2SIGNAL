The outer SELECT calculates the difference between two AVG aggregates. \n\n2. The first AVG aggregate calculates the average duration between FIRST(end_time) and LAST(end_time) over all rows.\n\n3. The second AVG aggregate calculates the same, but only for rows where the event_name occurs more than once. This is done via a subquery and FILTER clause.\n\n4. By subtracting the second average from the first, the final result is the difference between the average duration for all rows and the average duration for recurring events.\n\nI then translated each component into a simple human-readable sentence, while calling out the specific column names used.
