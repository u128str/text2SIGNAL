The main components I identified were:\n\n- The SELECT clause calculates a percentage by dividing two COUNT aggregates and multiplying by 100. \n\n- The two COUNT aggregates filter the 'case_id' rows based on different WHERE conditions. \n\n- The first COUNT filters for 'Inventory Target' > 'Stock on Hand' and month of 'MONTH' = current month.\n\n- The second COUNT only filters for month of 'MONTH' = current month.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the 'defaultview-404' table as the data source.\n\nI then translated each component into natural language, referring explicitly to the table name, column names, and filter values used in the original query. Finally, I composed the complete summary by connecting the component descriptions into a coherent paragraph.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE (\"Inventory Target\" > \"Stock on Hand\") \n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
