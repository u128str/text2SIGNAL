{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last end time of the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event that occurred within the past 3000 days and the first end time of the 'Create Sales Order Item' event, for all process instances in the 'defaultview-290' table.

Label this as 'Lead time: sales document item creation to delivery creation'.\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this summary:\n\n- The query is selecting the average (AVG) of a time difference calculation, so the summary describes this average calculation.\n\n- The time difference is between two subqueries - one for the last 'Create Outbound Delivery' event time, and one for the first 'Create Sales Order Item' event time. The summary describes these two subqueries. \n\n- The subqueries filter on specific event names and use LAST and FIRST to get the latest/earliest timestamp. The summary mentions the event names and the use of LAST/FIRST.\n\n- The first subquery also filters events within the past 3000 days. The summary includes this filter condition.\n\n- The final time difference is labeled \"Lead time: sales document item creation to delivery creation\". The summary includes this label.\n\n- The query is over the 'defaultview-290' table. The summary mentions this table name.\n\nSo in summary, the signal description explains the high-level logic of the query - the average time difference calculation over two filtered event timestamps, along with the specific details like table name, event names, and label.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG (\n\t(SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME \n\t\t\tIN ('Create Outbound Delivery') \n            AND((NOW() - LAST (END_TIME)) < DURATION '3000days')) - \n\t\t\t(SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Sales Order Item'))) \n\tAS \"Lead time: sales document item creation to delivery creation\"\nFROM \"defaultview-290\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
