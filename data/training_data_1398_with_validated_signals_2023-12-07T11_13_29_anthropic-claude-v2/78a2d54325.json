Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()) - this gets cases where the due date is before today\n- The FROM clause indicates the table is \"defaultview-225\"\n\nI then translated these key components into a human readable sentence summary, explicitly referring to the table name, column names, and values used in the query conditions.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
