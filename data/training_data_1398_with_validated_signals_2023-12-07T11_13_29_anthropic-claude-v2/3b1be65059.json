The subquery checks if there is any row where \"Change Type\" contains 'Update' (using ILIKE for case-insensitive matching).  BOOL_OR returns true if any row matches.\n\n- So I summarized that it counts case_id values where at least one row has 'Update' in the 'Change Type' column. \n\n- I mentioned that the matching for 'Update' is case-insensitive based on the ILIKE operator.\n\n- I referred to column names like 'Change Type' and values like 'Update' explicitly to make it more human-readable.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(case_id)) FILTER(\nWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Change Type\" ILIKE 'Update')))\nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
