Only include rows where the difference between the current time (NOW()) and the latest end time for events named 'Release PO' is greater than 45 days.\" \n}\n\nTo generate this description, I first identified the key components of the query:\n\n- The SELECT clause counts distinct 'case_id' values and aliases the result as 'Cases'. This indicates we need to count 'case_id' values from the table.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-124'.\n\n- The WHERE clause filters the rows where the difference between NOW() and the latest 'Release PO' end time is greater than 45 days. This requires looking up the latest 'Release PO' end time and comparing it to NOW().\n\nSo in plain language, the query is counting 'case_id' values from 'defaultview-124' where the time since the last 'Release PO' event is over 45 days. I assembled these key points into a human-readable summary explaining the query's purpose.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(NOW() - (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO')) - DURATION '25DAYS' > DURATION '45DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
