It is selecting a calculation from the 'defaultview-545' table\n2. The calculation determines the percentage of cases meeting two criteria out of cases meeting one criterion\n3. The two criteria are: \n   - Truncated 'Last GR Creation Date' is after 'PO Requested Delivery Date'\n   - 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received'\n4. The one criterion is:\n   - 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received'\n5. To calculate the percentage, it counts cases meeting each set of criteria, subtracts one count from 1, divides, and multiplies by 100\n\nI then translated this logical understanding into a plain English, human-readable set of instructions that references the specific table name, column names, and filter criteria used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(1 - \n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Requested Delivery Date\"\n\t\t\tAND \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'\n\t\t)\n\t/\n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'\n\t\t)\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
