This indicates the intent is to count rows.\n\n- The FILTER clause with a WHERE condition on 'event_name' being 'Unflag Issue' indicates the specific rows to count - ones where 'event_name' matches this value. \n\n- The table name 'defaultview-217' is specified in the FROM clause.\n\n- No specific values from columns are referenced, only column names.\n\nSo in plain language, the query counts rows from the 'defaultview-217' table where 'event_name' matches 'Unflag Issue'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\ncount(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Unflag Issue'))\n-- / count(case_id)\n\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
