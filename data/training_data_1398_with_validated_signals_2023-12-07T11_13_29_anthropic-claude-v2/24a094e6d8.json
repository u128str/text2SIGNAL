This indicates we need to count the number of rows matching the criteria.\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-225'.\n- The WHERE clause filters for rows where the column 'event_name' contains the sequence 'Post Invoice' directly followed by 'Update PO Payment Terms'. The MATCHES operator with the '~>' pattern denotes this direct sequence relationship.\n- Putting this all together results in a human-readable summary explaining which table is being queried, which column values are being counted, and the specific filter criteria on the 'event_name' column.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id)\nFROM \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES('Post Invoice' ~> 'Update PO Payment Terms') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
