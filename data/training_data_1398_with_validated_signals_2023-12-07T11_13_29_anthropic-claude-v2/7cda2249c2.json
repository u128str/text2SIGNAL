The outer SELECT and COUNT aggregates indicate it is calculating some percentage metric. Looking at the filter clauses, I saw it is filtering the rows twice - first for invoices paid late, then for non-null payment dates. Dividing these and multiplying by 100 gives a percentage. Knowing this overall purpose, I described it in simple human terms, explicitly calling out the table name, column names, filters, and calculations used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Invoice Due Date\" < \"Last Invoice Payment Date\")\n\t)\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NOT NULL)\n\t)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
