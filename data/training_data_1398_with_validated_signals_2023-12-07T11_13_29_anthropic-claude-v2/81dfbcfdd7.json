The summary describes this as getting the time for the last 'Clear Invoice' and first 'Post Invoice'.\n\n- The main AVG wraps the difference between these two subqueries, so the summary mentions this is calculating the time difference.\n\nSo in summary, the query was broken down into its main clauses and operations, and translated into a human-readable set of instructions describing the intent.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  )\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE\n  EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
