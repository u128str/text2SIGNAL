I then looked at the subqueries inside the AVG() to determine which columns were being referenced - 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date', 'Inv. Posting Document Date', and 'Inv. Converted USD Amount'. Based on the query logic, I described how these column values were being used - subtracting the first and last values of two date columns, multiplying by the last value of an amount column, and then averaging the result.
