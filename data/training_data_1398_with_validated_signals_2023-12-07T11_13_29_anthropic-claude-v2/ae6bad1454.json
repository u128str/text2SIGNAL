I looked at each part of the query:\n\n- The first computed column uses DATE_TRUNC to truncate the first end_time value for each month to just the month.\n\n- The second computed column counts distinct 'Last Invoice Id' values with specific filter criteria on two other columns. \n\n- The ORDER BY and FILL clauses order the results and fill in any missing months.\n\n- The column aliases provide descriptive labels for the computed columns.\n\nBy understanding the purpose and logic of each part of the query, I was able to summarize it in a human-readable form that references the specific table, columns and values used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST (end_time))) AS \"Date\",\nCOUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\")\nFILTER (WHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL) \nAND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())) AS \"Number of Invoices Overdue\"\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
