The subquery checks if there is any row where \"Change Type\" contains 'Update' (using ILIKE for case-insensitive matching).  BOOL_OR returns true if any row matches.\n\n- So I summarized the WHERE filter as \"where at least one row has a value in the 'Change Type' column that contains the substring 'Update' (case-insensitive)\".\n\n- I included the column names \"case_id\" and \"Change Type\" explicitly.\n\nSo in plain language, the query counts distinct case IDs where there is at least one change type containing \"Update\", on the \"defaultview-225\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT(case_id)) FILTER(\nWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Change Type\" ILIKE 'Update')))\nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
