This indicates we need to count the number of rows.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name \"defaultview-183\".\n\n- The WHERE clause compares two columns \"Actual Release Date\" and \"Scheduled Release Date\" using the < operator and a duration of 0 seconds. This filters the rows where the actual date is less than the scheduled date. \n\n- Putting this together results in a human readable summary of counting rows from the specified table where the actual release date is less than the scheduled release date by 0 seconds.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id)\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWhere \"Actual Release Date\" - \"Scheduled Release Date\" < DURATION '0seconds'\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
