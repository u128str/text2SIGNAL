Item Clearing Date\" is NULL and \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" is before today's date.\n\n- The second COUNT in the denominator filters for rows where \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" is NULL.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name \"defaultview-59\".\n\nI then summarized each component in plain language, explicitly calling out the table name, column names, filters, and calculations used. The result is a human-readable set of instructions that explains what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT (case_id) FILTER (\n        WHERE (\"Last Inv.
