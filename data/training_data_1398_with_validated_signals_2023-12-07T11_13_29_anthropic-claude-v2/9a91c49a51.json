The subqueries are used to find the last end_time for 'Create Goods Receipt' events and the first end_time for 'Create PO Item' events. I then referenced the main FROM clause to get the table name 'defaultview-57'. Putting this all together, I constructed a human-readable sentence summarizing the intent of the query operating on the specific table and columns referenced.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n    (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt'))\n    -(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n   )\n\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
