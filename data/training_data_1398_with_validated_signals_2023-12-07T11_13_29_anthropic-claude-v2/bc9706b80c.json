This indicates it is calculating an average time duration.\n\n- The subqueries are getting the last end time for 'Clear Invoice' events and the first end time for 'Create Invoice' events. This indicates it is looking at the time from creating to clearing an invoice.\n\n- This difference is being averaged over all process instances in the 'defaultview-529' table. \n\n- The average time difference is being aliased as 'PaymentTime'.\n\nSo in plain language, it is calculating the average payment time from invoice creation to invoice clearing for the 'defaultview-529' process.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS PaymentTime\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-529\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
