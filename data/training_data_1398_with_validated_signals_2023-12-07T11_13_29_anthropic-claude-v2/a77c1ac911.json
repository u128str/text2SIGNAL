I summarized this in plain language.\n- The second condition checks for at least one 'Post Invoice' event using BOOL_OR.\n- The third condition calculates the time difference between two events and checks if it is less than 25 days.\n\nFor each condition, I tried to capture the intent in a simple human-readable form, referring to the table, columns and values used in the original query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (NOT event_name MATCHES('Create Invoice' \t~> 'Post Invoice' \t~> 'Clear Invoice' \t~> 'Due Date passed')\n\tAND (SELECT BOOL_OR( event_name IN ('Post Invoice')))\n\tAND (SELECT\n\t\tLAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))\n\t\t-\n\t\tFIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Create Invoice'))\n\t) < DURATION '25days'\n\t)\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
