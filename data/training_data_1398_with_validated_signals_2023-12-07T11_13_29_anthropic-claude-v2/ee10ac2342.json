Multiply the result by 54.\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this summary, I first analyzed the SIGNAL query to understand its overall purpose and structure. The main query is selecting a calculation based on two filtered counts from the 'defaultview-404' table. \n\nThe first filtered count in the numerator counts 'case_id' rows that meet two conditions: 1) 'Inventory Target' > 'Stock on Hand', and 2) the month of 'MONTH' equals the current month. \n\nThe second filtered count in the denominator counts all 'case_id' rows where the month of 'MONTH' equals the current month.\n\nDividing the first count by the second count gives the percentage of rows meeting condition 1) out of all rows in the current month. Multiplying this by 54 scales the percentage to a full month.\n\nSo in plain language, the query is calculating the percentage of rows each month where inventory target exceeds stock on hand, and scaling that to the full month.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE (\"Inventory Target\" > \"Stock on Hand\") \n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n) * 54\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
