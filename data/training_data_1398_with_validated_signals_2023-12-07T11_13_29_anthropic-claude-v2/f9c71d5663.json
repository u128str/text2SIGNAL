Identify the table name used - 'defaultview-383'.\n\n2. Recognize the main query goal is to calculate a percentage value. \n\n3. The numerator counts distinct cases having at least one 'Update' change type. This is done via a subquery with BOOL_OR.\n\n4. The denominator counts total distinct cases. \n\n5. Divide the two counts and multiply by 100 to get a percentage value.\n\n6. Reference the specific column names and values used in the query like 'ChangeType' and 'Update'.\n\n7.
