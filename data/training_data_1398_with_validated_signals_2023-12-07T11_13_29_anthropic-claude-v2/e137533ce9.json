Item Due Date' is before the start of today.\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this summary, I first identified the key components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n- The SELECT and COUNT functions indicate we are counting rows.\n\n- The FILTER clause contains the conditions that filter the rows to count.\n\n- The table name 'defaultview-59' tells us which table the data is from.\n\n- The column names in quotes indicate which columns have the filter conditions. \n\n- The comparison operators like IS NULL and < compare the column values.\n\n- DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()) gets the start of the current day.\n\nSo I summarized it in plain language, referring to the table name, column names, comparison operators, and values like NULL and the start of today. This explains which rows from which table are being counted based on the filter conditions on the specified columns.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
