It is selecting a calculation based on values from the 'defaultview-545' table. \n\n2. It is counting case_id's that meet a certain filter criteria in the WHERE clause.\n\n3. It divides this count by another count of case_id's meeting a different filter criteria. \n\n4. It multiplies the result by 100.\n\nI then translated each logical step into a human-readable sentence, being sure to reference the specific column names and values checked in each filter criteria.
