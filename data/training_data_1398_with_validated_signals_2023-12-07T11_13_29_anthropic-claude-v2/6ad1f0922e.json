It is enclosed in double quotes, which indicates it is a column name. \n\n- FROM \"defaultview-270\" specifies the table name that the column belongs to. The table name is also enclosed in double quotes.\n\nI then composed a simple English sentence explaining that we want to calculate the average value of the 'SFC Initial Quantity' column from the 'defaultview-270' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\"SFC Initial Quantity\") FROM \"defaultview-270\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
