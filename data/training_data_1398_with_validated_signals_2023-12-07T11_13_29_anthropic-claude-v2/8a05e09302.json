Then I looked at the subqueries to understand how each column is calculated. The CASE statements categorize the 'CYCLE_TIME' into buckets and assign sequence numbers. The COUNT, SUM, and AVG aggregates calculate the other columns. The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses show how the results are grouped and sorted.
