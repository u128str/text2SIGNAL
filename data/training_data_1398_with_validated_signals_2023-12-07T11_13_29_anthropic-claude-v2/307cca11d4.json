This indicates it is calculating an average value.\n- The subquery is counting distinct 'UniqueEventId' values filtered by 'ChangeType' = 'Update'. This count is being performed per case due to the subquery.\n- Therefore, the overall query is calculating the average of the number of distinct 'UniqueEventId' per case where 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. \n- The table name 'defaultview-383' and column names are referenced explicitly.\n- The query alias \"Average number of changes per case\" is used to describe what the result represents.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Average number of changes per case\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
