Then I looked at each part of the SELECT statement:\n\n1. The DATE_TRUNC function truncates the start time of 'Vendor Creates Invoice' events to month granularity and aliases it as \"Month\".\n\n2. The SUM aggregate calculates the total of the 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' column and aliases it. \n\n3. The AVG aggregate calculates the average time difference between two event start/end times.\n\n4. The ORDER BY and NULLS FIRST clauses specify the sort order. \n\n5. The FILL TIMESERIES function fills in any missing months.\n\nFor each part, I described in simple terms what data is being selected and how it is being transformed, including the column names, event names, and aggregate functions used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('MONTH', (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Vendor Creates Invoice')))) AS \"Month\", \n\tSUM(\"Inv.
