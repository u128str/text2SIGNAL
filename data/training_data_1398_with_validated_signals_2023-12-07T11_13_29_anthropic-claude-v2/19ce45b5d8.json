The first column uses DATE_TRUNC to extract the month from the first 'end_time' for 'Create Issue' events. This provides the \"Month when Issue created\". \n\nThe second column counts 'case_id' with additional filtering on the 'event_name' column to match a specific sequence of events. This gives the \"# Cases\".\n\nThe FROM clause specifies the table being queried - 'defaultview-217'. \n\nThe GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses indicate the results are grouped and sorted by \"Month when Issue created\".\n\nPutting this all together results in a human-readable summary of the key information in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))) AS \"Month when Issue created\",\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE event_name MATCHES('Create Issue' -> 'Change Status to To Do')\n    ) AS \"# Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
