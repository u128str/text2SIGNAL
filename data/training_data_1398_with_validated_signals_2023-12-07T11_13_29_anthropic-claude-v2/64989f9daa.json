{"signal_description": "The query is selecting two columns from the table 'defaultview-183'. The first column is 'count(event_name)' which is aliased as 'Confirmations'.

There is also a derived column using the if() function that outputs 'Confirmed' if event_name is 'Confirmed', otherwise outputs 'Partially confirmed'.
