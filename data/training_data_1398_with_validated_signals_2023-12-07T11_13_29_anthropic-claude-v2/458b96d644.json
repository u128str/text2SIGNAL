This indicates it is calculating an aggregate value based on the 'event_name' column.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-225'.\n\n- The WHERE clause filters for 'event_name' being either 'Change Invoice Due Date' or 'Change Baseline Date'. \n\n- So in simple terms, it is counting the number of those specific events in the given table, dividing by 1000, and returning the result.\n\n- I summarized this in simple human language, explicitly calling out the table name, column name, filter values, and aggregate calculation performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    count(event_name) / 1000\nFROM\n    FLATTEN(\"defaultview-225\")\nWHERE\n    event_name IN ('Change Invoice Due Date', 'Change Baseline Date') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
