I looked at the derived table subquery to understand how the columns were being calculated. For 'Payment Time', it uses two subqueries to find the last 'Pay Invoice' and first 'Receive Invoice' events, takes the time difference, and averages it. 'No. of Invoices' counts cases based on a condition. The outer query filters on 'Payment Time' not null and orders the results. With this understanding, I summarized it in plain language referring to the specific table name, column names, and values used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Last PR Item Type\",\n  PaymentTime AS \"Payment Time\",\n  \"No. of Invoices\"\nFROM\n  (\n    SELECT\n      \"Last PR Item Type\"   ,\n      AVG (\n        (\n          SELECT\n            LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n              WHERE\n                EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice')\n            )\n        ) - (\n          SELECT\n            FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n              WHERE\n                EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')\n            )\n        )\n      ) AS PaymentTime,\n      COUNT(case_id) AS \"No. of Invoices\"\n    FROM\n      \"defaultview-545\"\n    WHERE\n      (\n        \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < \"Last Invoice Payment Date\"\n      )\n    ORDER BY\n      2 DESC\n  ) AS selection\nWHERE\n  \"PaymentTime\" IS NOT NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
