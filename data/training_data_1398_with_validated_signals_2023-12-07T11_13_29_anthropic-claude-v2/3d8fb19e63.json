Add 11.32 to the result\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this summary, I first broke down the SIGNAL query into logical steps:\n\n1. The main query is to calculate a ratio using two aggregated counts from the 'defaultview-404' table. \n\n2. The first count in the numerator uses a FILTER clause with two conditions - one to compare event times, and one to check if the truncated month equals 'MONTH'. \n\n3. The second count in the denominator has a WHERE clause with two range conditions on the 'MONTH' value.\n\n4. After the ratio is calculated, it is multiplied by 100 and a constant 11.32 is added.\n\n5. I translated each logical step into a simple human-readable sentence, explicitly mentioning the table name, column names, values, and operations used.\n\n6. The final summary combines these sentences in the order the operations are performed in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Finalize Inventory Plan'))\n\t\t> (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Run Inventory Optimization'))\n\t)\n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n) * 100 + 11.32\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
