{"signal_description": "The query selects the 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Name' column and a CASE expression that checks the 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1', 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1', and 'Last PO Vendor Master Cash Discount Days 1' column values to determine the 'Immediate PT behavior'. It groups the results by the 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Name' and CASE expression columns. For each group, it counts the number of case IDs where 'Last Inv.
