It counts those filtered case_id values \n5. It subtracts the count of duplicates from the total count\n6. It divides that result by the total count to get a percentage \n7. It subtracts that percentage from 100 to flip it to the percentage of non-duplicates\n\nI then translated those logical steps into a human-readable paragraph summary, explicitly referring to the table name, column names, and operations on their values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n100 - (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE\n\t(SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub\n)\n)/COUNT(case_id)*100)\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
