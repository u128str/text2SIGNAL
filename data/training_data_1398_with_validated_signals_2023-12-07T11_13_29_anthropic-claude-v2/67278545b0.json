SUM() specifies we want the sum of the values.\n\n- The column name in SUM() provides the column whose values should be summed (\"Inv. Converted USD Amount\").\n\n- The FILTER clause specifies a condition that filters the rows included in the sum (WHERE clause).\n\n- The WHERE clause gives the filter condition - column name, operator, and column name+values being compared (\"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\").\n\n- The FROM clause provides the table name these columns belong to (\"defaultview-133\").\n\nI then translated these key components into a human-readable sentence summary explaining what data the query is asking for and any conditions on that data.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT SUM(\"Inv.
