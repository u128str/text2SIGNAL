The key steps were:\n\n1. Identify the table name 'defaultview-197' that is used. \n\n2. Explain the FLATTEN operation on that table.\n\n3. List out the selected columns case_id, end_time, BillingDocument, event_name.\n\n4. Explain the AVG_ClearingTime calculation using end_time and FIRST/FILTER. \n\n5. Explain the Flag calculation using CASE WHEN on event_name. \n\n6. Note the FILTER on event_name.\n\n7. Explain the GROUP BY on DATE_TRUNC of end_time as 'Clearing Date'.\n\n8. Explain the aggregate calculations of COUNT DISTINCT and AVG. \n\n9. Note the ORDER BY on '#Billing Docs'.\n\n10.
