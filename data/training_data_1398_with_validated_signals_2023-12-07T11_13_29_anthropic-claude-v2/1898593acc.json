I looked at the aggregation function (AVG) and expression to understand what is being averaged. \n\nThe expression uses two subqueries - one to get the last end time for 'Receive Invoice' events, and another to get the first end time for 'Create PO Item' events. So it is calculating the time difference between these events.\n\nThe filter on the main query ensures only cases where both events exist are considered. \n\nI referenced the specific table name, event names, and end time column used to create a human-readable summary explaining what data is being queried and how the average value is calculated.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))      \nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Receive Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
