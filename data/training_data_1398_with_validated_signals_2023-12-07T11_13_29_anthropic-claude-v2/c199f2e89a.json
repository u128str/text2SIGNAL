{"signal_description": "From the 'defaultview-124' table, count the number of CASE_ID values where the time difference between the latest END_TIME for events named 'Clear Invoice' and the earliest END_TIME for events named 'Create FI Invoice' is greater than 9 days.

Store this count in a column named 'No. of Cases'.\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this description, I first analyzed the main SELECT statement to understand that it is counting CASE_ID values from the 'defaultview-124' table and storing the result in a column named 'No. of Cases'. \n\nI then looked at the WHERE clause and broke it down into two parts:\n\n1. The subquery (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice') finds the latest END_TIME for 'Clear Invoice' events.\n\n2. The subquery (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice') finds the earliest END_TIME for 'Create FI Invoice' events.\n\n3. These two subqueries are subtracted to find the time difference. \n\n4. This time difference is compared to the duration '9DAYS' to filter the rows where the time difference is greater.\n\nBy combining the understanding of the main query and the WHERE clause, I constructed a human-readable description that summarizes the key information in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) AS \"No. of Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice') > DURATION '9DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
