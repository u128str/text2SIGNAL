I then parsed the WHERE clause to understand the conditions being checked on each of these columns. Using this information, I constructed simple English sentences explaining what data is being selected from the table and what conditions it must satisfy. The count and distinct keywords indicate that we are counting distinct values of 'Product ID'.
