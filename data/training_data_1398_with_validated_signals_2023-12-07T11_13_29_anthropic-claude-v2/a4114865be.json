By dividing these and multiplying by 100, it calculates a percentage.\n\nSo I summarized it in plain language, explicitly mentioning the table name, column names, and values used in the query conditions and calculations.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Update Payment Term'))\n\t) / (SELECT COUNT(event_name))\n   ) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
