This count must be > 0.\n- The filtered COUNT is divided by total COUNT of 'case_id' and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage value.\n\nWith this understanding, I summarized the query in plain language, explicitly mentioning the table name, column names, filter conditions and aggregate operations. The description explains the logic step-by-step as a human would instruct someone else to calculate the metric from the table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT COUNT(event_name)\n\t\t\tWHERE (\"DeliveryGoodsMovementOnTime\" = 'Yes')) > 0\n\t)\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-383\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
