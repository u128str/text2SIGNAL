The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-383'. \n\n2. The first COUNT/FILTER counts CASE_ID rows where the invoice is past due (current date > InvoiceDueDate) and unpaid (InvoiceAccountingClearingDate is null).\n\n3. The second COUNT/FILTER counts CASE_ID rows where the event name matches 'Create Invoice'. \n\n4. The final calculation divides the overdue/unpaid count by the total invoices count and multiplies by 100 to calculate a percentage metric called 'No Payment Rate'.\n\nI then translated each component into a human-readable instructional step referring to the specific table name, column names, and filter values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\n        WHERE\n          (\n            (\n              NOW() > (\"InvoiceDueDate\")\n            )\n            AND (\"InvoiceAccountingClearingDate\" IS NULL)\n          )\n      ) > 0\n  ) / COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Invoice')) * 100 AS \"No Payment Rate\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
