The column names and bucket ranges are explicitly listed.\n\n- The WHERE clause filters for rows where \"Scheduled Release Date\" is after \"Actual Release Date\", so this condition is summarized.\n\n- The order by clause sorts the results by the time difference buckets, so this is noted.\n\n- Key details like column names, table name, value ranges are explicitly written out to make the summary human-readable.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) as \"Early releases\",\n\nCase\n\tWhen \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '5days'\n    THEN '0-5 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '5days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '10days'\n    THEN 'b) 5-10 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '10days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '15days'\n    THEN 'c) 10-15 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '15days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '20days'\n    THEN 'd) 15-20 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '20days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '25days'\n    THEN 'e) 20-25 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '25days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '30days'\n    THEN 'f) 25-30 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '30days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '35days'\n    THEN 'g) 30-35 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '35days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '40days'\n    THEN 'h) 35-40 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '40days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '45days'\n    THEN 'i) 40-45 days'\n    When \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '45days'\n\tAND \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" <= Duration '50days'\n    THEN 'j) 45-50 days'\n    ELSE 'k) >50 days'\nEND AS \"Time difference\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'\norder by 2 asc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
