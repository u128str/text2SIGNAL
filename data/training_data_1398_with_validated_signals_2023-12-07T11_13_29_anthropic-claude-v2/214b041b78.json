Fill in missing months in the time series with null values.\"\n}\n\nTo generate this summary, I first analyzed the SIGNAL query to understand the intent behind each part:\n\n1. The DATE_TRUNC function is being used to truncate the date to month granularity. FIRST is getting the first occurrence of the 'Create PO Item' event. So this is getting the month of PO creation. \n\n2. The FILTER clause is filtering for only 'Pay Invoice' events.\n\n3. The complex CASE expression in the COUNT is counting cases where the specified event sequence occurred. This is being divided by the total count of cases to get a percentage conformance rate.\n\n4. The results are grouped by the truncated PO creation date and ordered chronologically. \n\n5. FILL TIMESERIES is filling in any missing months with null values.\n\nWith this understanding, I summarized each part in plain language, referencing the specific table, columns, values etc. to end up with a human-readable description of what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"PO Creation Date\", \n\n\tCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES (\n    'Create PR item' ~>\n    'Create PO Item' ~>\n    'Receive PO item' ~>\n    ('Receive Invoice' ~> 'Reconcile Invoice') ~>\n    'Pay Invoice')) \n\t/ COUNT (CASE_ID)\n    * 100 AS \"Conformance Rate\"\n\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Pay Invoice')\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
