This indicates it is calculating an average value.\n\n- The subquery is doing (LAST(end_time)) - (FIRST(end_time)). This is subtracting the first value from the last value of the 'end_time' column.\n\n- The outer query takes the AVG() of this difference. So it is averaging the difference between the first and last values across all rows. \n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-529'.\n\nSo in simple terms, it is averaging how much the 'end_time' values change from the first row to the last row, across the entire 'defaultview-529' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))\nFROM \"defaultview-529\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
