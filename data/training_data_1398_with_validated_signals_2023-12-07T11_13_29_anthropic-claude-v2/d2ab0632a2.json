This indicates it is calculating the average difference between these columns.\n\n- The FILTER clause specifies a condition that the difference must be greater than 0 minutes. \n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name as \"defaultview-270\".\n\n- No specific row values are referenced, only column names, so the summary references the column names in a human-readable format.\n\n- The overall intent is summarized as calculating an average time difference between two columns, filtered to rows where the difference is positive, on a specific table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n\t\"Order Actual Start\" - \"Order Scheduled Start\") \n    FILTER( WHERE \"Order Actual Start\" - \"Order Scheduled Start\" > DURATION '0minutes' )\nFROM \"defaultview-270\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
