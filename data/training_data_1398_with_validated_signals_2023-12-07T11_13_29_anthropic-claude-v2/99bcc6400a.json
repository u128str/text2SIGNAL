The outer SELECT COUNT indicates that we want to count something. The FILTER clause contains the conditions that determine which rows should be counted. \n\nI then looked at the subquery inside the FILTER to see the specific conditions being checked - event name, ClearingDate being NULL, and the datediff check. \n\nFinally, I translated these technical details into a human-readable set of instructions that explains in plain language what data is being queried and what criteria is being used to filter it.
