By dividing them and converting to a percentage, the query is calculating the percentage of ARUniqueKey values meeting the additional date filter, out of the total number of 'Clear' events.\n\nKnowing this, I summarized it in simple English referring to the specific table, columns and filter values used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (\nCOUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Clear%' \nAND (ClearingDate   - NetDueDate)  > DURATION '1day')  \n/ COUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Clear%' ) \n) * 100\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
