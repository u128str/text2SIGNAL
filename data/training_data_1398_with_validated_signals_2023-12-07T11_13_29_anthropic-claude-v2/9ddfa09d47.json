It is then subtracting the 'Flag Issue' time from the 'Unflag Issue' time. This calculates the time difference between the two events.\n\n- The outer query takes the AVG of these time differences.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-217'.\n\nSo in human terms, it is calculating the average time difference between specific events, across the given table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name = 'Unflag Issue')\n      - (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n         WHERE event_name = 'Flag Issue')\n        )\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
