This indicates the intent is to count rows.\n\n- The FILTER clause with a WHERE condition on the 'event_name' column filters the rows before counting. The MATCHES operator checks for a substring match.\n\n- The table name 'defaultview-183' provides context on where the data is coming from. \n\n- The column names 'case_id' and 'event_name' indicate which fields of the table are being queried.\n\n- The text value 'Confirmed' is used in the filter condition, so it is mentioned explicitly.\n\nBy examining the key components of the query - SELECT, FILTER, table name, column names, values - I constructed a human-readable summary explaining what the query does.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) FILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Confirmed')) FROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
