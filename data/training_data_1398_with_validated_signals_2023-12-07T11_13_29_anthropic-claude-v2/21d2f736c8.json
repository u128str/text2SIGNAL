I translated the SIGNAL syntax like COUNT(), FILTER(), and WHERE into plain language. I explicitly called out the table name 'defaultview-217' and column names 'case_id' and 'event_name'. For event_name I spelled out the specific value filtered on - 'Change Status to In Progress'.\n\nPutting this all together results in a human-readable summary explaining the query's purpose and construction in plain language.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) \nFILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 1 )\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\nWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) \nWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 0 )\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
