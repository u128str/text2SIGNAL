Identifying the table name 'defaultview-299' from the FROM clause.\n\n2. Looking at the SELECT clause and breaking it down:\n- SUM() aggregates the inner query \n- The inner query counts CASE_IDs filtered by the condition EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'). \n- This gives us the count of CASE_IDs where the event occurred.\n\n3. The outer query divides the sum by the total COUNT(CASE_ID) to get a ratio. \n\n4.
