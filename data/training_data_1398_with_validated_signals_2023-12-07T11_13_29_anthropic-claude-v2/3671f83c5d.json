Recognized the inner SELECTs were getting the first and last values of the 'end_time' column based on the SELECT first() and SELECT last() calls.\n\n3. Saw the main operation was taking the average of the difference between these first and last times based on the AVG() call. \n\n4. Noticed the FILTER clause was removing any rows where 'Event Created By User Type' was 'System' or 'Service' based on the IN condition.\n\n5.
