Converted USD Amount' column, so that column name is referenced.\n\n- There is a FILTER clause restricting the rows where 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' is NULL, so that column name and condition are referenced. \n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-133', so that name is referenced.\n\n- The overall query sums the 'Inv.
