This indicates we should only include rows where event_name is not 'Clear Invoice'. \n\n- The query is operating on the 'defaultview-59' table, referenced in the FROM clause.\n\n- end_time and event_name are column names referenced in the query.\n\nSo in plain language, the query is calculating the average duration between first and last end_times, excluding any rows where event_name is 'Clear Invoice', on the 'defaultview-59' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))) IS NULL\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
