{"signal_description": "This query selects the 'Last PO Vendor Name' column and renames it to 'Vendor Name'. It then calculates two aggregate columns: 1) 'Missed Cash Discounts in $', which is the sum of the invoice amount multiplied by the cash discount days minus the cash discount amount for each row where the item due date is before the clearing date, and 2) 'Invoice Amount in $', which sums the 'Inv.
