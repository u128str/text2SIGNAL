This becomes the denominator.\n\n- The subquery counts OCCURRENCE of each EVENT_NAME and checks if any occur more than 3 times. \n\n- The outer COUNT(CASE_ID) with FILTER counts CASE_IDs where the inner query returns true. This becomes the numerator.\n\n- Finally, the percentage is calculated using the numerator and denominator.\n\nI then translated this step-by-step understanding into a human-readable paragraph summary explaining the intent and logic behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 3) FROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(EVENT_NAME) AS occurrence) AS sub)) / COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS \"Percent of cases affected by rework\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE ((SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('Dialog')))) \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
