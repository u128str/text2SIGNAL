Amount\".\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name \"defaultview-124\". \n\n- The WHERE clause filters for rows where the time between two events is greater than a duration. This uses subqueries on the END_TIME column to find the first and last occurrence of each event.\n\nI then combined these key elements into plain English sentences, explicitly calling out the table name, column names, and filter values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nSUM(\"Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.\") AS \"Total Inv.
