This is done by counting the cases where the number of 'DeliveryGoodsMovementOnTime' events with value 'Yes' is greater than 0.\n\n3. Count the number of cases that had a 'Create Outbound Delivery' event. This is done by checking if the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event name exists for each case.\n\n4. Divide the 'On-time delivery' count by the 'Create Outbound Delivery' count and multiply by 100 to get the percentage 'On-time delivery rate'.\n\n5.
