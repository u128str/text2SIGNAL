This tells me the summary should mention the table name and those column names.\n\n- The FILTER clause specifies a condition, so I included that the average should only consider rows where the difference is greater than 0 minutes. \n\n- The query is calculating an average, so I summarized it as \"calculate the average difference between [columns]\".\n\n- I referred to column names and the table name explicitly to make it clear which values are being operated on.\n\nSo in plain language, the query is calculating the average amount that orders started later than scheduled, considering only orders that started late, from a specific table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG (\"Order Actual Start\" - \"Order Scheduled Start\") \nFILTER (WHERE \"Order Actual Start\" - \"Order Scheduled Start\" > DURATION '0minutes')\nFROM \"defaultview-538\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
