The main components are:\n\n- The SELECT clause calculates a ratio by dividing a fixed duration (4 hours) by an average duration calculated from the table. \n\n- The AVG() aggregate function calculates the average duration between two events - 'Create Invoice' and 'Clear Invoice'.\n\n- The two nested subqueries find the last end time for 'Create Invoice' events and the first end time for 'Clear Invoice' events. \n\n- The difference between these two times gives the duration between the two events.\n\n- The average of these durations is calculated over all rows in the 'defaultview-59' table.\n\nBy examining the query structure, table name, column names, and intent, I composed a human-readable summary explaining the high-level purpose and method of the query in plain language.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(DURATION '4hours')/\nAVG(\n\t(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Create Invoice')\n\t)\n\t-\n(SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Clear Invoice')\n)\n)\n )\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
