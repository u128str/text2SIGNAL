Cycle Time\", so the description mentions calculating an average time difference and aliasing it.\n- The FROM clause indicates the table name is 'defaultview-124', so that is referenced. \n- The average is calculated from two subqueries - one gets the LAST end time for 'Release PO' events, and the other gets the FIRST end time for 'Create PO Item' events. So the description mentions finding these specific event times.\n- The time difference is calculated between these two event times, so the description mentions this calculation.\n- No specific column names or values are referenced other than the event names, so no other columns are mentioned.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO')\n- (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item'))\nAS \"Avg.
