It counts the occurrences of 'Last Invoice Id' as 'DuplicateCount' \n5. It filters for DuplicateCount > 1\n6. It counts the distinct 'Last Invoice Id' values\n\nI then translated each step into a human-readable sentence, referring explicitly to the table name, column names, and filter values used in the original query.
