This tells us what data we are interested in.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name - 'defaultview-222'.\n\n- The WHERE clause filters the rows to only those where 'EVENT_NAME' matches a certain pattern. This indicates the criteria for including rows.\n\n- The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses show how the results are grouped and sorted.\n\n- The column names like 'end_time', 'ARUniqueKey', 'EVENT_NAME' indicate which table columns are being used.\n\nBy putting together all these pieces in plain English, I was able to create a human-readable summary of what the query is doing.
