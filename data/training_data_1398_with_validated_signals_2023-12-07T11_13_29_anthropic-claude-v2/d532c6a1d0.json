To do this:\n1. Count the number of cases that have a non-null 'PO Item Contract ID' and 'Catalog' in 'PO Item Line Type'. \n2. Count the total number of cases that have 'Catalog' in 'PO Item Line Type'.\n3. Divide the count from step 1 by the count from step 2.\n4. Multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage value. \n5.
