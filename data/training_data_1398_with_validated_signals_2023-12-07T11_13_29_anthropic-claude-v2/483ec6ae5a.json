Item Due Date' column is less than the value in the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' column.\"\n}\n\nTo generate this summary:\n\n- The query performs a SELECT with a COUNT aggregate function, so it is counting rows.\n\n- The COUNT is on the \"case_id\" column, so it is counting the number of case IDs. \n\n- The FILTER clause indicates a WHERE condition is being applied.\n\n- The WHERE condition compares two column names - \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" and \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\".\n\n- The < operator indicates the first column value should be less than the second column value.\n\n- The table name \"defaultview-133\" is referenced in the FROM clause.\n\nSo in plain language, the query counts rows from the \"defaultview-133\" table where the \"Last Inv.

Item Clearing Date\" value.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
