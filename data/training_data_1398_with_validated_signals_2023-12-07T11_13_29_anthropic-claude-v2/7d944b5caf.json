Item Cash Discount Days 1' is NULL or 0. This filters the rows that are included in the sum.\n\n- So in summary, it is calculating a summed value from one column, while filtering the rows based on values in another column, for a specific table.\n\nThe summary describes the key elements of the query - the table name, column names, aggregate function, and filter conditions - in a human-readable format.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\nSUM(\"Inv.
