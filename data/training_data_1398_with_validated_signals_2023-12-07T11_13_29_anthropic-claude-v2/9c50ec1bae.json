Accounting Document Number\" - the column name\n- FROM - indicates the table name that follows \n- \"defaultview-225\" - the table name\n\nI then translated this to a human-readable instruction set:\n\n- Count the number of unique values \n- In the 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' column\n- From the 'defaultview-225' table\n\nSo in plain language, the query is counting distinct values from a specific column in a specific table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"Inv.
