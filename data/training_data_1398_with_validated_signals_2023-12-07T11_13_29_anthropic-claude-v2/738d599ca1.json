Filter the 'defaultview-222' table to only rows where EVENT_NAME contains 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. \n\n2. From these rows, count the distinct values in the ARUniqueKey column. This is the denominator.\n\n3. Filter again to only rows where ClearingDate is > NetDueDate by at least 1 day. \n\n4. Count the distinct ARUniqueKey values. This is the numerator.\n\n5. Divide the numerator by denominator to get a percentage.\n\nI then translated this logical flow into plain English, explicitly mentioning the table name, column names, filters, and aggregate calculations performed.
