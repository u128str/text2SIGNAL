{"signal_description": "From the 'defaultview-9' table, calculate the percentage of process instances that contain the 'Create Invoice' activity followed by the 'Receive Payment' activity out of all process instances in the table. To do this:\n1. Count the number of process instances that contain the sequence 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Receive Payment'. This is done using the FILTER and MATCHES functions.\n2. Count the total number of process instances in the table. \n3. Divide the count from step 1 by the count from step 2. \n4. Multiply the result by 100 to get a percentage value.\n5.
