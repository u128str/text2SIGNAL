This indicates only rows where the value in this column is not 'Done' should be counted. \n- The FROM clause specifies the table being queried is \"defaultview-370\".\n- Putting this together results in a human readable summary of counting rows from the 'defaultview-370' table where the 'Current Status category' value is not 'Done'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\ncount(\"case_id\") FILTER ( WHERE \"Current Status category\" != 'Done')\nFROM \"defaultview-370\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
