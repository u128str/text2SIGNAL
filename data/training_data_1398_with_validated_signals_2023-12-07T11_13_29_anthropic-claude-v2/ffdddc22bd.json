Item Clearing Date' and 'Last Inv. Item Due Date') indicate which columns are being checked.\n\n- The comparison operators (IS NULL, <) and values (DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())) show how the column values are being compared.\n\nI then translated these key components into a human-readable sentence summary explaining what data the query is operating on and what conditions it is applying.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\"Last Inv.
