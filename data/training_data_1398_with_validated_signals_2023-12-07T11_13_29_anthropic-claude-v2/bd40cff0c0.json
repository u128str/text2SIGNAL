Using COUNT() and DISTINCT shows we want a distinct count rather than a total count.\n\n- The FROM clause specifies the table name 'defaultview-222'.\n\n- The WHERE clause filters for rows where 'event_name' equals a specific value. \n\nI then translated each component into plain language, explicitly referring to the table name, column names, and filter values used in the original query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  )\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")\nWHERE event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
