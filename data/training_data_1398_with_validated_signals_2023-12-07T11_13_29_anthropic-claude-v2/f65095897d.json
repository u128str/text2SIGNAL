It filters for 'EVENT_NAME' = 'Pay Invoice' where applicable.\n\nThe results are ordered by 'Late Payment Rate %' descending and then 'Cleared Amount' descending.\"\n\nTo summarize:\n- The query aggregates payment data by vendor and company code\n- It calculates metrics like number of invoices, total amount paid, late payment percentage, etc.\n- The results show vendors ranked by their late payment percentage and amount paid\n- The summary describes the meaning of each column and metric calculation\n- It also explains the underlying derived table and filtering used\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
