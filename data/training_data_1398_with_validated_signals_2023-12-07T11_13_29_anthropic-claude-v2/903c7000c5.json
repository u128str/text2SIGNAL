I then looked at the two subqueries inside the AVG functions to understand what was being averaged in each case. For the first subquery, it was averaging the end time of events named 'Complete Supply Planning' with a completed status. For the second, it was the same but for events named 'Start Supply Planning'. Finally, I put together the human-readable description explaining that it was calculating the difference between the averages of those two event types.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Complete Supply Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\n-\nAVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Start Supply Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
