This indicates it is calculating an average time between two events.\n\n- The two subqueries are getting the first and last end times of specific event names, 'Receive Invoice' and 'Pay Invoice'. \n\n- These first and last times are being subtracted to get a time difference.\n\n- This is done for each case, then averaged across cases by the outer query.\n\n- The table name 'defaultview-545' provides context.\n\nSo in plain language, it calculates the average payment time by looking at the time between receiving and paying invoices for each case.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS PaymentTime\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
