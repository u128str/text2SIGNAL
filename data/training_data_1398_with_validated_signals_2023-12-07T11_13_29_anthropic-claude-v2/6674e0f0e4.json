Then, from this intermediate table, calculate the overall average of the average clearing times.\"  \n}\n\nTo generate this summary, I first analyzed the query to understand the overall logic:\n\n1. It is calculating some average clearing time value, ultimately taking the AVG of this value.\n\n2. It is doing this over a derived table defined in the FROM clause, so the main logic happens there.\n\n3. The derived table calculates a clearing time for each case/event pair by taking the difference between two end_time values. \n\n4. These end_time values are for specific events, filtered by the event_name and using window functions.\n\n5. The filtering and window functions partition/group by the ARUniqueKey column.\n\nSo in plain language, it is calculating a clearing time per case, finding the average for each case, and then averaging those averages.
