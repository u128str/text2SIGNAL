The time difference is obtained by subtracting the last end time of the 'Create PO Item' event from the last end time of the 'Release PO' event. These last end times are obtained through subqueries on the same table 'defaultview-124' and filtering on the event names. The average of this time difference is then calculated over all the rows in the 'defaultview-124' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - \n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item'))\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
