{"signal_description": "From the 'defaultview-383' table, calculate the percentage of distinct case IDs where at least one row for that case ID has a 'ChangeType' value of 'Update'. To do this:\n1. Count the number of distinct case_id values in the table. \n2. Filter to only those rows where the ChangeType column has a value of 'Update' for that case_id. \n3. Use BOOL_OR to check if any of the rows for that case_id have ChangeType='Update'.  \n4. Count the number of distinct case_ids where this is true.\n5. Divide the count from step 4 by the count from step 1.\n6. Multiply this by 100 to get the percentage value.\n7.
