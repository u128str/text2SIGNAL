Identifying the table name 'defaultview-545' that the query is running on.\n\n2. Looking at the SELECT clause to see what columns are being returned - 'Invoice creation date' and 'AVG Cycle Time'. \n\n3. Breaking down how each of those columns is calculated:\n- 'Invoice creation date' uses DATE_TRUNC to get the month of the last end time for 'Create Invoice' events.\n\n- 'AVG Cycle Time' calculates the average difference between the last end time for 'Clear Invoice' events and the first end time for 'Create Invoice' events.\n\n4. Noting the ORDER BY and NULLS FIRST clauses to sort the results.\n\n5. Explaining the FILL timeseries clause which fills in any missing months.\n\n6.
