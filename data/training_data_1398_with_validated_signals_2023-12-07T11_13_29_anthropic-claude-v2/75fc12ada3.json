This time difference is between the last end time of 'Receive Invoice' events and the first end time of 'Create PO Item' events.\n\n- The time difference calculation is done using two subqueries - one to get the last 'Receive Invoice' end time, and one to get the first 'Create PO Item' end time.\n\n- The main query filters to only include rows where the event name matches 'Create PO Item' or 'Receive Invoice'. \n\n- The table being queried is 'defaultview-545'.\n\nSo the human-readable summary explains the high-level intent of the query - to calculate the average time between two event types, filtered to relevant rows.
