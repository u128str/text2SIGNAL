Item Due Date' < 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date'  \n- The ORDER BY clause specifies the sort order\n\nI then went through each component, referring to the original column names, and translated them into plain English descriptions of what data is being selected/filtered/sorted. Things like column renames, aggregate functions, and filter logic were spelled out.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Company Code Name\",\n  \"No. of Invoices paid late\",\n  \"Invoice Amount in $ paid late\",\n  \"RCA Posted as Overdue\",\n  \"RCA Short Payment Terms\",\n  \"RCA High Rework Rate\",\n  \"RCA Dunning Block Release\",\n  \"RCA Low Automation of Invoice Postings\",\n  \"RCA Credit Memo Documents after Invoice Creation\",\n  \"RCA Manual Changes\"\nFROM\n  (\n    SELECT\n      \"Inv.
