It takes the last end_time for 'Closed' events and the first for 'In Progress'.\n- The FILTER clause looks for the given event sequence in each row.\n- The GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses group and order by the first column.\n\nBy understanding the purpose of each part of the query, I was able to summarize it in plain language referring to the specific column names, values and operations used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed')) AS \"Month when Issue Closed\",\nAVG( \n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed') \n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress')\n    )\nFILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Progress' ~> 'Change Status to Closed') ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
