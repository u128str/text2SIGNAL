I then looked at the SELECT statement to understand that it is calculating a percentage based on a count of case IDs filtered by a condition on the 'Actual Start Date' and 'Scheduled Start Date' columns. By breaking down the individual components, I was able to explain in plain language what data is being selected from what table and how the percentage value is being calculated.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (count(case_id)\nFILTER (WHERE \"Actual Start Date\" - \"Scheduled Start Date\" > DURATION '0seconds')\n /\n count(case_id)) \n *100\n \n  FROM \"defaultview-183\"\n\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
