This tells us the table name and one of the column names.\n\n- The FILTER clause with a WHERE indicates a condition that needs to be satisfied to include the case_id values in the count. \n\n- The subquery checks if the event_name is NOT IN ('Close Incident'). This tells us another column name 'event_name' and a specific value it is checking for.\n\n- Putting this together results in the human readable summary describing which table, columns, values are being referenced and the overall filtering logic of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \n\t(SELECT BOOL_AND(\n NOT event_name IN ('Close Incident')))\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
