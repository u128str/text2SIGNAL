I then examined the FILTER clauses to determine the conditions being checked on the 'Actual Release Date' and 'Scheduled Release Date' columns. The COUNT and arithmetic operations were interpreted to understand how the '# Process Orders Released Early' and '% Released Early' calculated columns are derived. Finally, the ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses indicated how the results are sorted and limited.
