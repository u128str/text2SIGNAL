Count distinct TimesheetRecord records where event_name is in ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', 'Cancel Timesheet Record')\n\nSo in simple terms, it is counting distinct TimesheetRecord records for 'Create', subtracting the distinct counts for 'Approve', 'Auto-Approve' and 'Cancel'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT Count(distinct TimesheetRecord) \nFILTER \n(WHERE event_name = 'Create Timesheet Record')\n-\n Count(distinct TimesheetRecord) \nFILTER \n(WHERE event_name IN ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', 'Cancel Timesheet Record'))\n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n"}
