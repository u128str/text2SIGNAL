Item Clearing Date' > 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is greater than 0\n- This filtered count is divided by the total count of case_id, and multiplied by 100\n\nUsing this understanding, I summarized the query in plain language, explicitly mentioning the table name, column names, operators, and values used in the original SIGNAL query. The description explains the calculation step-by-step as a human would describe it.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "You are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n        WHERE (SELECT COUNT(event_name)\n                        WHERE (\"Last Inv.
