{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves information from the 'defaultview-124' table. It calculates the cycle time by subtracting the first end time from the last end time. It also calculates the time it takes for a purchase order (PO) to be released after it is created by subtracting the last end time of the 'Release PO' event from the last end time of the 'Create PO Item' event. Additionally, it calculates the percentage of the PO release time compared to the cycle time. The query selects the 'Case ID', 'Cycle Time', 'PO Create to PO Release Time', 'PO Release Time as % of Cycle Time', 'PO Vendor Name', 'PO Type', 'PO Item Material Group Text', 'PO Item Net Order Value', and 'Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.' columns. The results are ordered by the third column in descending order. Only records where the PO Create to PO Release Time is less than or equal to 3 days are included.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves information from the 'defaultview-124' table.
