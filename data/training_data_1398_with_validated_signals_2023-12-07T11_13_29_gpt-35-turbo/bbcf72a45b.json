It selects the following columns: 'Change Category', 'Change Type', 'Event Name', '# Occurrences', '# Manual Changes', and 'Automation Rate in %'. The 'Change Category' column is derived based on the 'event_name' column. If the 'event_name' contains 'Sales Doc', it is labeled as 'Sales Doc'.

The '# Manual Changes' column represents the count of distinct 'UniqueEventId' values where the 'EventCreatedByUserType' is 'Dialog'. The 'Automation Rate in %' column is calculated by dividing the count of distinct 'UniqueEventId' values where the 'EventCreatedByUserType' is either 'System', 'Service', or 'Batch Job' by the total count of distinct 'UniqueEventId' values and multiplying it by 100.
