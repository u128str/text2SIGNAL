{"signal_description": "The query retrieves the PO Creation Date and the Conformance Rate for a specific event. The table used in the query is 'defaultview-124'. The 'PO Creation Date' is calculated by taking the first 'end_time' value from the events with the name 'Create PO Item' and truncating it to the month level. The 'Conformance Rate' is calculated by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' values where the event name matches a specific pattern and dividing it by the total count of 'CASE_ID' values, then multiplying it by 100.
