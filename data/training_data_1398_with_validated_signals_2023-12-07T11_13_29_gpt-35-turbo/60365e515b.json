{"signal_description": "The query retrieves information from the 'defaultview-57' table. It calculates the occurrence of each event, the automation rate in percentage, the average lead time, the minimum lead time, and the maximum lead time. The 'Event Name' column represents the name of the event. The 'Following event' column represents the event that follows each event. The 'Occurrence' column counts the number of times each event occurs. The 'Automation Rate in %' column calculates the percentage of events created by the system or service. The 'AVG Lead Time' column calculates the average time it takes for an event to complete. The 'MIN Lead Time' column shows the shortest time it takes for an event to complete. The 'MAX Lead Time' column shows the longest time it takes for an event to complete. The query filters out events with null cycle times and groups the results by the 'Event Name' and 'Following event' columns.
