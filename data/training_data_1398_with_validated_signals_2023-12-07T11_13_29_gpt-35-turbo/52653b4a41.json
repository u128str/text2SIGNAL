{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves the 'Invoice Post Date' and the 'Percentage of automated events' from the 'defaultview-225' table. It filters the data based on the 'EVENT_NAME' column, selecting only rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Vendor Creates Invoice'. The 'Invoice Post Date' is calculated by taking the last 'END_TIME' value where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Post Invoice' and truncating it to the month level. The 'Percentage of automated events' is calculated by dividing the count of 'EVENT_NAME' values where the 'Event Created By User Type' is either 'System' or 'Service' by the total count of 'EVENT_NAME' values, and then multiplying it by 100. The result is ordered in ascending order by the 'Invoice Post Date' and filled with null values for missing time series data points.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves the 'Invoice Post Date' and the 'Percentage of automated events' from the 'defaultview-225' table.
