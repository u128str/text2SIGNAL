The 'Posted as Overdue' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is null and the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is less than the current date. The 'High Rework Rate' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is less than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and there is at least one occurrence of an event other than 'Receive PO Item'.
