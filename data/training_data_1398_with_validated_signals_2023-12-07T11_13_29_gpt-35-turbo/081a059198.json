{"signal_description": "Calculate the late delivery rate and categorize the release status based on the given criteria. The query is performed on the 'defaultview-183' table. The late delivery rate is calculated by counting the number of case_id where the 'Actual Delivery Date' minus the 'Scheduled Finish Date' is greater than 0 seconds, and dividing it by the total count of case_id. The result is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. The release status is determined by comparing the 'Actual Release Date' minus the 'Scheduled Release Date' with 0 seconds. If it is less than 0 seconds, the status is 'Early'. If it is greater than 0 seconds, the status is 'Late'. Otherwise, the status is 'on-time'.
