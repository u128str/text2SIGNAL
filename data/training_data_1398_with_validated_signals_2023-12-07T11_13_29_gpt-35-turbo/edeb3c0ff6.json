{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves data from the 'defaultview-545' table. It calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first 'end_time' value from the last 'end_time' value. The resulting cycle time is grouped by quarters and the 'PO Business Unit' column. The query filters the data based on the 'END_TIME' column, ensuring that the last date truncated to day is greater than or equal to '2022-01-01' and the first date truncated to day is less than or equal to '2022-06-30'. Additionally, it excludes rows where the 'PO Item Line Type' column is null. The results are ordered by the 'PO Business Unit' column in ascending order and the 'Quarter' column in ascending order with nulls first. The query fills any missing quarters with null values and limits the result to 500 rows.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves data from the 'defaultview-545' table.
