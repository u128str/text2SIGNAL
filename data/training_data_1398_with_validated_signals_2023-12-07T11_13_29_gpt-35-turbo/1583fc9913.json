{"signal_description": "The query retrieves information about invoices from the 'defaultview-529' table. It includes the following columns: 'Customer Number', 'Company Code Name', 'SO Category', 'Inv. Document Type Text', 'No. Invoices', 'Invoiced Value in $', 'Late Payment Rate', 'No. Paid Late Invoices', and 'Invoice Amount Paid Late in $'. The 'Customer Number' column represents the customer number associated with the invoice. The 'Company Code Name' column represents the name of the company code. The 'SO Category' column categorizes the invoice as either a 'Non-SO Invoice' or an 'SO Invoice'. The 'Inv. Document Type Text' column represents the document type of the invoice. The 'No. Invoices' column displays the total number of invoices. The 'Invoiced Value in $' column shows the total invoiced value in dollars. The 'Late Payment Rate' column calculates the percentage of late payments by dividing the count of invoices with due dates before clearing dates by the count of invoices with clearing dates, multiplied by 100. The 'No. Paid Late Invoices' column displays the number of invoices paid late. The 'Invoice Amount Paid Late in $' column shows the total amount of invoices paid late in dollars. The query filters out rows where the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' is not null and groups the results by the first four columns. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the fifth column.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"The query retrieves information about invoices from the 'defaultview-529' table.
