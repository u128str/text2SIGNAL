The 'In Progress => Ready for Review' column calculates the average time difference between the last 'Change Status to Ready for Review' event and the first 'Change Status to In Progress' event. The 'Ready for Review => In Review' column calculates the average time difference between the last 'Change Status to In Review' event and the first 'Change Status to Ready for Review' event.
