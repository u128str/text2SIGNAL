It counts the number of case_id values and selects the following columns: 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1', 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1', 'Last PO Vendor Master Cash Discount Days 1', 'Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period', 'Last Inv. Item Terms of Payment Key'. It also calculates two metrics: 'Payment Terms better on PO' and 'Immediate Payment Terms'. The query filters the 'Payment Terms better on PO' metric by comparing the 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' column with the 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1' column. The 'Immediate Payment Terms' metric is filtered by checking if the 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' column is null or equal to 0.
