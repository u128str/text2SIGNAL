{"signal_description": "The query calculates the 'Invoice Clearing Date' and the 'Payment Rate' for a specific table named 'defaultview-529'. The 'Invoice Clearing Date' is determined by finding the last 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Invoice' in the table. The 'Payment Rate' is calculated by dividing the count of 'case_id' where the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is less than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' by the count of 'case_id' where the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' is not null, and then multiplying it by 100. The query filters the data by selecting only the rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'. The results are ordered in ascending order of the 'Invoice Clearing Date' and filled with missing values using a timeseries of 'Month'.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"The query calculates the 'Invoice Clearing Date' and the 'Payment Rate' for a specific table named 'defaultview-529'.
