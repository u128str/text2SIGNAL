{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves data from the table 'defaultview-225'. It selects the following columns: 'Inv. Company Code' as 'Company Code', 'Inv. Company Code Text' as 'Company Code Name', 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Number' as 'Vendor Number', 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Name' as 'Vendor Name', and a calculated column called 'Immediate PT behaviour'. The 'Immediate PT behaviour' column is determined based on the values of the columns 'Last PO Vendor Master Cash Discount Days 1', 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1', and 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1'. If 'Last PO Vendor Master Cash Discount Days 1' is 0, the value is set to 'Immediate PT in Master Data'. If 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1' is 0, the value is set to 'Immediate PT on PO'. If 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1' is not 0 and 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' is 0, the value is set to 'Immediate PT on Invoice but not on PO'. If 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' is not 0 and 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1' is 0, the value is set to 'Immediate PT on PO but not on Invoice'. Otherwise, the value is set to 'ok'. The query also includes two aggregate functions: COUNT(case_id) as 'Number of Invoices' and SUM('Inv. Converted USD Amount') as 'Invoice Amounts'. These aggregate functions are filtered based on the conditions 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' = 0 and 'Last PO Cash Discount Days 1' != 0. The result is grouped by the columns 'Company Code', 'Company Code Name', 'Vendor Number', 'Vendor Name', and 'Immediate PT behaviour', and ordered by 'Vendor Number' in descending order.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves data from the table 'defaultview-225'.
