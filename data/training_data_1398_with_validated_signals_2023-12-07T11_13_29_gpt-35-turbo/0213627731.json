The columns included in the query are 'Company Code Name', 'Last Inv. Item Customer Number', '# Cleared Invoices', 'Cleared Amount', 'Late Payment Rate % (rounded)', 'AVG Net Payment Terms', 'AVG Payment Time', and 'AVG Paid Late Days'. The 'Late Payment Rate % (rounded)' column is calculated based on the average 'Late Payment Rate %' column. If the remainder of dividing the average by 1 is greater than or equal to 0.5, 1 is added to the average, otherwise, the remainder is subtracted. The 'Late Payment Rate %' column is calculated as the percentage of cleared invoices that were paid late. The 'AVG Net Payment Terms' column represents the average number of days between the due date and the accounting document date for cleared invoices. The 'AVG Payment Time' column represents the average number of days between the clearing date and the accounting document date for cleared invoices. The 'AVG Paid Late Days' column represents the average number of days that cleared invoices were paid late, excluding cases where the clearing date is before the due date.
