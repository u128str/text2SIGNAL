{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query summarizes invoice data from the 'defaultview-529' table. It retrieves the following columns: 'Customer Number', 'Company Code Name', 'SO Category', 'Inv. Document Type Text', 'No. Invoices', 'Invoiced Value in $', 'Early Payment Rate', 'No. Paid Early Invoices', and 'Invoice Amount Paid Early in $'. The query groups the data by the first four columns and orders the result by the ninth column in descending order. The 'SO Category' column is derived using a CASE statement, where if the 'Last Inv. Item Sales Document' is NULL, it is labeled as 'Non-SO Invoice', otherwise it is labeled as 'SO Invoice'. The 'No. Invoices' column represents the count of 'case_id' values. The 'Invoiced Value in $' column represents the sum of 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' values. The 'Early Payment Rate' column calculates the percentage of invoices that were paid early, based on certain conditions. The 'No. Paid Early Invoices' column represents the count of invoices that were paid early. The 'Invoice Amount Paid Early in $' column represents the sum of invoice amounts that were paid early.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query summarizes invoice data from the 'defaultview-529' table.
