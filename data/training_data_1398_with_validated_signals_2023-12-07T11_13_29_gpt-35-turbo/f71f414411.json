{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query retrieves data from the 'defaultview-545' table. It calculates the 'PO Creation Date' by finding the first 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is 'Create PO Item' and truncates it to the month.

The result is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. The query then orders the results by the 'PO Creation Date' in ascending order and fills any missing values with NULL.
