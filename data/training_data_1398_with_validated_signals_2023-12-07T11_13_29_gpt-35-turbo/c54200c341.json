{"signal_description": "The query retrieves the number of bug tickets, the date of issue creation, and the average time it takes for an issue to be started by a user after it is created.

The 'Number of bug tickets' column represents the count of Case_id values where the IssueType is 'Bug' and the event_name matches either 'Create Issue' or 'Change Status to In Progress'. The 'Issue Creation Date' column is derived by taking the first end_time value where the event_name is 'Create Issue' and truncating it to the month level.
