{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves information about invoices and compares the payment terms between the invoice and the vendor master data. The query is performed on the 'defaultview-225' table. The selected columns include the invoice company code, vendor country, vendor number, vendor name, terms of payment key, vendor master payment terms, case ID, cash discount days 1 and 2, vendor master cash discount days 1 and 2, net payment terms period, and vendor master net payment terms period. The query calculates the maximum number of days for the invoice and the vendor master data based on the available payment terms. It then checks if the cash discount days and net payment terms period in the invoice are shorter than the corresponding values in the vendor master data. If any of these conditions are met, the query returns a specific message indicating the payment term mismatch. Additionally, the query counts the number of invoices with shorter payment terms and provides the terms of payment key on the invoice and the vendor master data, as well as the cash discount days and net payment terms period on both the invoice and the vendor master data. The results are ordered in descending order based on the vendor name.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves information about invoices and compares the payment terms between the invoice and the vendor master data.
