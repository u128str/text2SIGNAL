{"signal_description": "The query retrieves information from the 'defaultview-545' table. It selects the columns 'PO Item Category', 'PO Item Line Type', and 'PO Item Supplier ID'. It calculates the number of distinct 'PO Item ID' as 'Number of PO Item' and the number of distinct 'case_id' as 'Number of PO Line item'. It also calculates the sum of 'PO Item Total Amount' as 'Total Spend $'. Additionally, it calculates the sum of 'Last Invoice Item Amount' where 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is null and 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the current date. This is calculated as 'Total Open Invoice Amount $'. The average cycle time is calculated by subtracting the last 'END_TIME' for the event 'Receive PO Item' from the first 'END_TIME' for the event 'Receive Invoice'. This is then averaged. Finally, it calculates the sum of 'Last Invoice Item Discount Amount' as 'Received Discount $'. The query filters the results by 'PO Item Line Type' being either 'Catalog' or 'NonCatalog', 'PO Item Supplier ID' not being null, and 'PO Item Line Type' not being null. The results are grouped by 'PO Item Category', 'PO Item Line Type', and 'PO Item Supplier ID', and sorted in descending order based on the 'Number of PO Item' column.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"The query retrieves information from the 'defaultview-545' table.
