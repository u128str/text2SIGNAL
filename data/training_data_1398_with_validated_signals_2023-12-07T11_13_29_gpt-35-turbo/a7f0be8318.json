{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query retrieves information about invoices from the 'defaultview-225' table. The query selects the following columns: 'Vendor Number', 'Vendor Name', 'Vendor Country', 'Company Code Name', 'PO Category', 'Inv. Document Type Text', 'Last PO Purchasing Group', 'Last PO Type', 'Last PO Item Material Group', 'Last PO Item Plant Name', 'No. Invoices', 'Invoiced Value in $', 'Early Payment Rate', 'No. Paid Early Invoices', and 'Invoice Amount Paid Early in $'. The query groups the results by these columns and orders them by the 'No. Paid Early Invoices' column in descending order. The 'Early Payment Rate' column is calculated by dividing the count of invoices meeting certain conditions by the count of invoices meeting different conditions, and then multiplying the result by 100. The 'No. Paid Early Invoices' column is the count of invoices meeting the same conditions. The 'Invoice Amount Paid Early in $' column is the sum of the 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' column for invoices meeting the same conditions.", "llm_output": "{\n  \"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query retrieves information about invoices from the 'defaultview-225' table.
