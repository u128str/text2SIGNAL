Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for the above data which would
show the compliance rate for standard invoicing with payment received. 
Compliance rate represents the count of cases exhibiting specific patterns / behaviours / sequences of events, divided by the total number of cases. 
In this example we combine SIGNAL FILTER and MATCHES expressions count cases exhibiting a specific event pattern.

>>>>>>>>  Prompt 1.1 Compliance Example 1: Compliance Rate for Standard Invoice Processing

Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for the above data which would
show the compliance rate for standard invoicing with payment received.
The respective event names are 'Create Invoice' and 'Receive Payment'.
Compliance rate represents the count of cases exhibiting specific patterns / behaviours / sequences of events, 
divided by the total number of cases.
Combine SIGNAL FILTER and MATCHES expressions count cases exhibiting a specific event pattern.

>>>>>>>>>> prompt 2.0 Unpaid Invoices with Non Evaluated Risk Class

Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for Unpaid Invoices by Risk Class (Standard Process Deviation).
Count of cases where invoice payment has not been received according to customer risk class. 
We calculate this by counting the cases exhibiting specific behaviours, 
specifically the event 'Create Invoice' is not followed by the event 'Receive Payment' or 'Cancel Invoice', 
and group the result by the case level attribute 'Risk Class'. 
A behaviour is an expression evaluating case or event level attributes and can be used in a pattern matching expression.

>>>>>>>>>> prompt 2.1 Unpaid Invoices with Non Evaluated Risk Class

Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for Unpaid Invoices by Risk Class (Standard Process Deviation).
Count of cases where invoice payment has not been received according to customer risk class event 'Not evaluated'. 
We calculate this by counting the cases exhibiting specific behaviours, 
specifically the event 'Create Invoice' is not followed by the event 'Receive Payment' or 'Cancel Invoice', 
and group the result by the case level attribute 'Risk Class'. 
A behaviour is an expression evaluating case or event level attributes and can be used in a pattern matching expression.

>>>>>>>>>> prompt 2.2 Unpaid Invoices with Non Evaluated Risk Class

Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for Unpaid Invoices by Risk Class (Standard Process Deviation).
Count of cases where invoice payment has not been received according to customer risk class 'Not evaluated'. 
We calculate this by counting the cases exhibiting specific behaviours, 
specifically the event 'Create Invoice' is not followed by the event 'Receive Payment' or 'Cancel Invoice', 
and group the result by the case level attribute 'Risk Class'. 
A behaviour is an expression evaluating case or event level attributes and can be used in a pattern matching expression.

>>>>>>>>>> prompt 2.3 Unpaid Invoices with Non Evaluated Risk Class

Your goal is to construct SIGNAL query for Unpaid Invoices by Risk Class (Standard Process Deviation).
Count of cases where invoice payment has not been received according to customer risk class, i.e., 
their attribute 'Risk Class' has value 'Not evaluated'. 
We calculate this by counting the 'Unpaid invoices' cases exhibiting specific behaviours, 
specifically the event 'Create Invoice' is not followed by the event 'Receive Payment' or 'Cancel Invoice'.
Take into account that apart from the above other events are possible.
