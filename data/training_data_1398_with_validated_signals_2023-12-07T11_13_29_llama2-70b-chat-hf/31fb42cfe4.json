SELECT: The query starts with a SELECT clause, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. AVG: The query uses the AVG aggregation function, which calculates the average value of a set of numbers.\n3. (SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')): This subquery selects the last END_TIME value for all records where the EVENT_NAME is in the list ('Clear Invoice').\n4. - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')): This subquery selects the first END_TIME value for all records where the EVENT_NAME is in the list ('Post Invoice').\n5. FROM \"defaultview-225\": The query specifies the table to use for the selection, which is named \"defaultview-225\".\n6. WHERE 'Last Payment Clearing Date' IS NOT NULL: The query filters the records to only include those where the 'Last Payment Clearing Date' column is not null.\n7. AND \"event_name\" MATCHES ('Post Invoice'~> 'Clear Invoice'): The query filters the records to only include those where the 'Event Name' column matches the pattern 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n\nBy combining these parts, we can understand that the query is calculating the average time difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Post Invoice' event for each record in the 'defaultview-225' table, where the 'Last Payment Clearing Date' is not null and the 'Event Name' column matches the pattern 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice'))) \n        \nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \nWHERE 'Last Payment Clearing Date' IS NOT NULL\nAND \"event_name\" MATCHES ('Post Invoice'~> 'Clear Invoice')\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
