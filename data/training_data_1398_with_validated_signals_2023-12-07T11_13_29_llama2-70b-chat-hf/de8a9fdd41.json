The first set of tasks have names starting with 'Start' and routing step 0030, while the second set of tasks have names starting with 'Complete' and routing step 0020.\n* The second part of the query selects the first end time of tasks with name 'Create SFC'.\n* The query then calculates the WIP Time by taking the difference between the start and end times of the tasks with names starting with 'Start' and routing step 0020, and adds it to the difference between the start and end times of the tasks with names starting with 'Complete' and routing step 0010.\n* Finally, the query orders the results by the second column.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-270\" is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it is assumed to be the table that contains the data for the process. The column names used in the query are:\n\n* END_TIME\n* EVENT_NAME\n* ROUTING_STEP\n* DATE_PART (used to extract the hour of the end time)\n\nThe values used in the query are:\n\n* 'Start%' and 'Complete%' for the EVENT_NAME filter\n* '0030', '0020', and '0010' for the ROUTING_STEP filter\n* 'hour' for the DATE_PART function.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG (((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Start%' AND \"Routing Step\" = '0030')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Complete%' AND \"Routing Step\" = '0020'))) + ((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Start%' AND \"Routing Step\" = '0020')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Complete%' AND \"Routing Step\" = '0010')))) AS \"WIP Time\", \nDATE_PART('hour', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name='Create SFC'))) AS \"SFC Creation Time\"\nFROM \"defaultview-270\"\nORDER BY 2 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
