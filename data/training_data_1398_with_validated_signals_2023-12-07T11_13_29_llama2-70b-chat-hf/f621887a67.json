This part retrieves the first 'end_time' value for each group of 'CASE_ID's that have an 'EVENT_NAME' of 'Post Invoice' and truncates it to the first day of the month.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Vendor Creates Invoice' ~> 'Post Invoice' ~> 'Due Date passed' ~> 'Clear Invoice')) / COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS 'Conformance Rate'\". This part calculates the conformance rate by dividing the count of 'CASE_ID's that have an 'EVENT_NAME' of 'Clear Invoice' by the total count of 'CASE_ID's, and then multiplying the result by 100.\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-225'\". This part specifies the table to use for the query.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Clear Invoice') AND EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\". This part filters the results to only include rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Invoice' and the 'EVENT_NAME' is also 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n* The fifth part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL\".
