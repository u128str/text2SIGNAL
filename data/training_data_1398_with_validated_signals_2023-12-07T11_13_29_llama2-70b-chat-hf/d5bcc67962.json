Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses the COUNT function to count the number of case_id that meet certain conditions.\n\t* The conditions are specified using the FILTER clause, which filters the rows based on the specified conditions.\n\t* The conditions are:\n\t\t+ The current date (NOW()) is greater than the PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date.\n\t\t+ The PO Item Delivery Completed is null.\n4. Constructing the signal_description by describing the logic of the query in a human-readable format, using the identified column names and values.\n\nThe signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which helps users understand the purpose and logic of the query without having to read the actual query.
