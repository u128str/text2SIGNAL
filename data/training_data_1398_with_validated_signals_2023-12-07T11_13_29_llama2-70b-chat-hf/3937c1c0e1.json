SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. SUM: The first part of the query is a SUM function, which is used to calculate the total count of events that match certain criteria.\n3. (SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (WHERE ((\"Event Created By User Type\" = 'Dialog')  AND (event_name <> 'Create Invoice')))): This part of the query is a subquery that calculates the count of events that have a 'Dialog' user type and an event name that is not 'Create Invoice'. The FILTER clause is used to filter the data based on these conditions.\n4. / SUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))): The result of the subquery is then divided by the total count of events in the table, which is calculated using the SUM function.\n5. * 100: The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n6.
