{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of rows in the 'defaultview-9' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT COUNT(1) AS \"Case Count\" FROM \"defaultview-9\"` can be broken down into several parts.\n\n* `SELECT`: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* `COUNT(1)`: This function counts the number of rows in the table. The `1` in the parentheses indicates that we want to count the number of rows, rather than the number of columns.\n* `AS \"Case Count\"`: This part defines an alias for the column that will contain the count value. The alias is \"Case Count\".\n* `FROM \"defaultview-9\"`: This part specifies the table from which we want to retrieve data. The table name is \"defaultview-9\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as: \"Retrieve the count of rows in the 'defaultview-9' table.\"\n\nTherefore, the output result in JSON format is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of rows in the 'defaultview-9' table.\"\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
