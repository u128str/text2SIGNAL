This part is describing the calculation of the late delivery rate, which is the percentage of cases where the actual delivery date is later than the scheduled finish date.\n* The second part of the query is \"avg('Actual Delivery Date' - 'Scheduled Finish Date') Filter(WHERE 'Actual Delivery Date' - 'Scheduled Finish Date' > DURATION '0seconds') as 'Avg delay'\". This part is describing the calculation of the average delay, which is the average of the differences between the actual delivery date and scheduled finish date for the cases that meet the filter criteria.\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-183'\".
