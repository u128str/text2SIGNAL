{"signal_description": "Counting the number of events with name 'event_name' from the 'defaultview-545' table.", "llm_output": "\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Counting the number of events with name 'event_name' from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is selecting the COUNT of the 'event_name' column from the 'FLATTEN(\"defaultview-545\")' table. The 'FLATTEN' function is used to flatten a nested table into a flat table, allowing us to access the columns directly. In this case, the 'defaultview-545' table is the input table for the query.\n\nThe query can be read as follows:\n\n1. SELECT: The SELECT clause selects the columns that we want to include in the output. In this case, we are only selecting one column, which is the COUNT of the 'event_name' column.\n2. COUNT(event_name): The COUNT function is used to count the number of non-null values in the 'event_name' column. The 'event_name' column is referenced directly since it is a column in the 'defaultview-545' table.\n3. FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-545\"): The FROM clause specifies the table that we want to query. In this case, we are querying the 'defaultview-545' table, which has been flattened using the 'FLATTEN' function.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should accurately reflect the intent of the query, which is to count the number of events with the name 'event_name' from the 'defaultview-545' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(event_name)\n    \nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-545\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
