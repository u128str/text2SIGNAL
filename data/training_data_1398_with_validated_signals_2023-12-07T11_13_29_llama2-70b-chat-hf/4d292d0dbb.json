Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* The column names: \"case_id\", \"end_time\", \"event_name\"\n\t* The filter condition: \"event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review')\"\n\t* The aggregation function: \"COUNT(case_id)\"\n\t* The date part function: \"DATE_PART('hour', ...)\"\n\t* The order by clause: \"ORDER BY 2\"\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts and describing each part in a human-readable format:\n\t* \"SELECT count(case_id) as '# of Tickets'\" - This part retrieves the number of tickets (i.e., the number of rows in the table) and assigns it to a column named \"# of Tickets\".\n\t* \"DATE_PART('hour',(SELECT FIRST(\"end_time\") FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Review'))) AS \"Hour\"\" - This part retrieves the hour of the day (i.e., the hour component of the \"end_time\" column) for the rows where the \"event_name\" column matches \"Change Status to In Review\". The \"FIRST\" function is used to retrieve the first occurrence of the \"end_time\" column for each group of rows that match the filter condition, and the \"DATE_PART\" function is used to extract the hour component from the resulting date/time value.\n\t* \"FROM \"defaultview-217\"\" - This part specifies the table to query.\n\t* \"WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review')\" - This part filters the results to only include rows where the \"event_name\" column matches the specified pattern.\n\t* \"ORDER BY 2\" - This part sorts the results by the second column (i.e., the \"Hour\" column) in ascending order.\n3.
