{"signal_description": "Retrieve the total count of billing documents from the 'defaultview-222' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the total count of billing documents from the 'defaultview-222' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT SUM(\"BillingDoc_TotalCount\") FROM \"defaultview-222\"` can be broken down into several parts.\n\n* `SELECT`: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* `SUM(\"BillingDoc_TotalCount\")`: This part of the query specifies that we want to sum up the values in the \"BillingDoc_TotalCount\" column. The column name is enclosed in double quotes to indicate that it is a column name and not a literal string.\n* `FROM \"defaultview-222\"`: This part of the query specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data. The table name is enclosed in double quotes to indicate that it is a table name and not a literal string.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows: \"Retrieve the total count of billing documents from the 'defaultview-222' table.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column name, and respective value (i.e., the total count of billing documents) used in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\"BillingDoc_TotalCount\")\nFROM \"defaultview-222\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
