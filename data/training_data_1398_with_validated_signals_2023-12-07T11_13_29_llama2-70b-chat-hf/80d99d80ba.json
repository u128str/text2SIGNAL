The filter clause is applied to only consider rows where the event_name is either 'Create Sales Order Item' or any of its child events. The BOOL_OR function is used to check if the event_name is in the specified list.\n\nThe query can be read as follows:\n\n* SELECT: Select a column from the table.\n* COUNT(DISTINCT SalesDocId): Count the number of unique SalesDocId.\n* FILTER (WHERE ...): Apply a filter to the rows to be counted.\n* (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name IN ('Create Sales Order Item'))): Check if the event_name is either 'Create Sales Order Item' or any of its child events.\n* FROM \"defaultview-290\": Select the table to count from.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(DISTINCT SalesDocId) FILTER (WHERE \n\t (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name IN ('Create Sales Order Item'))))\nFROM \"defaultview-290\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
