SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Invoice Post Date\" and \"Automation rate\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"Invoice Post Date\", is calculated using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates a date to a specific interval (in this case, months). The function takes two arguments: the interval (month) and the date to be truncated.\n3. FIRST function:\nThe date to be truncated is obtained using the FIRST function, which returns the first value of a specified column from a subquery.\n4. Subquery:\nThe subquery filters the events based on the event name (\"Post Invoice\") and the user type (excluding Diague users).\n5. SUM and COUNT functions:\nThe second column, \"Automation rate\", is calculated by dividing the sum of the number of events that match the filter criteria by the total number of events. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n6. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n7. WHERE clause:\nThe events that match the filter criteria are selected based on the event name (\"Post Invoice\" followed by \"Clear Invoice\").\n8. ORDER BY clause:\nThe results are sorted by the first column (Invoice Post Date) in ascending order, with NULL values sorted first.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a concise and clear explanation of the SIGNAL query's purpose and functionality.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'month',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Invoice Post Date\",\n  SUM (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            (\"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Diague'))\n        )\n    )\n  ) / SUM (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\n    )\n  ) * 100 AS \"Automation rate\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE\n  event_name MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'),\n  NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
