The query then selects various columns, including \"AR_Customer,\" \"Customer,\" \"# of Projects,\" \"# Cleared Receivables,\" \"Cleared Amount,\" \"Late Payment Rate % (rounded),\" \"AVG Net Payment Terms,\" \"AVG Payment Time,\" and \"AVG Paid Late Days.\"\n\nThe \"Late Payment Rate % (rounded)\" column is calculated by taking the average of the \"Late Payment Rate %\" column, rounding it up to the nearest whole number, and then subtracting 1. The \"AVG Paid Late Days\" column is calculated using a case statement that returns null if the average payment date is less than 0 days, and otherwise returns the average payment date.\n\nThe query also includes several subqueries and filters to calculate the various columns. The \"# of Projects\" column is calculated by counting the number of distinct \"case_id\" values. The \"# Cleared Receivables\" column is calculated by counting the number of distinct \"ARUniqueKey\" values that match a specific filter. The \"Cleared Amount\" column is calculated by summing up the \"AmountInCompanyCodeCurrency\" values that match the same filter. The \"Late Payment Rate %\" column is calculated by counting the number of \"ARUniqueKey\" values that match a specific filter and dividing that number by the total number of \"ARUniqueKey\" values.\n\nThe query is ordered by the third and fifth columns in descending order.\n\nIn summary, the Signal query summarized describes a query that retrieves data from a table called \"defaultview-197,\" filters the data to only include rows where the \"ClearingDate\" and \"NetDueDate\" columns are not null, and then selects various columns, including some calculated columns, and orders the data by the third and fifth columns in descending order.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"AR_Customer\" AS \"Customer Number\",\n\"Customer\" ,\n\"# of Projects\",\n\"# Cleared Receivables\", \n\"Cleared Amount\",\n--\"Late Payment Rate %\",\nCASE\n    WHEN (avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1) >= 0.5 \n    THEN avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") - \n(avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1) + 1\n    ELSE avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") - \n(avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1)\nEND AS \"Late Payment Rate % (rounded)\",\n\n\"AVG Net Payment Terms\",\n\"AVG Payment Time\",\n\"AVG Paid Late Days\"\n\nFROM (\nSELECT \n\"AR_CustomerName\" AS \"Customer\",\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"case_id\" ) AS \"# of Projects\",\nCOUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' ) \nAs \"# Cleared Receivables\", \nSUM(\"AmountInCompanyCodeCurrency\" )\nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' )\nAs \"Cleared Amount\",\n(\nCOUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' \nAND (ClearingDate   - NetDueDate)  > DURATION '1day')  \n/ COUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' ) \n) * 100\nAS \"Late Payment Rate %\",\n\nAVG (\"NetDueDate\" - \"DocumentDate\" ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' ) \nAs \"AVG Net Payment Terms\",\n\nAVG (\"ClearingDate\" - \"DocumentDate\" ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' ) \nAs \"AVG Payment Time\",\n\nCASE \nWHEN AVG (\"ClearingDate\" - \"NetDueDate\") < DURATION '0day' \nTHEN NULL\nELSE\nAVG (\"ClearingDate\" - \"NetDueDate\")\nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' )\nEND AS \"AVG Paid Late Days\",\n\"AR_Customer\" \n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\nWHERE \"ClearingDate\" IS NOT NULL AND \"NetDueDate\" IS NOT NULL\n) as selections\nORDER BY 3 DESC, 5 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
