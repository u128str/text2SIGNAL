Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects a single column, COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\"), and filters the results using a WHERE clause.\n\t* The filter uses a BEHAVIOR function to match events created by a system, service, or batch job, and a MATCHES function to filter events with a specific name and change type.\n\t* The query is applied to the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") table.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The BEHAVIOR function is used to filter events created by a system, service, or batch job.\n\t* The MATCHES function is used to filter events with a specific name and change type.\n\t* The COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") function counts the number of unique event IDs that match the filter criteria.\n\t* The result is divided by the total number of unique event IDs in the table to get a percentage.\n3. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* The description starts by stating the main purpose of the query, which is to count the percentage of unique event IDs that match certain criteria.\n\t* The criteria are then listed, including the event name and change type, and the fact that the events must be created by a system, service, or batch job.\n\t* The description mentions the table name, \"defaultview-383\", and the fact that the query applies to all events in the table.\n\t* The description ends by stating the formula used to calculate the percentage, which is the ratio of the number of matching events to the total number of unique event IDs in the table, multiplied by 100.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('System', 'Service', 'Batch Job')\n        AND (\n          event_name LIKE '%Quotation%'\n          AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n      ) AS created_auto MATCHES (created_auto)\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") * 100\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\nWHERE\n  (\n    event_name LIKE '%Quotation%'\n    AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n  ) \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
