First, we filter the cases using a subquery that selects the last 'End Time' of an event named 'Pay Invoice' and subtracts the first 'End Time' of an event named 'Approve Invoice'. This subquery returns a table with the difference between the two times for each case.\n2. We then filter this table to only include cases where the difference is less than 14 days.\n3. Next, we count the number of cases that pass this filter.\n4. Finally, we divide the number of cases by the total number of cases to get the percentage of invoices that were approved within 14 days.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-431\" is used in the SIGNAL query, and the column names used are \"CASE_ID\", \"END_TIME\", \"EVENT_NAME\".
