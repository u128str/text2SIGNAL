The values are obtained by filtering the \"defaultview-270\" table for specific event names and routing step values.\n\nThe first part of the query uses the FIRST function to retrieve the end time of the first event with a name starting with \"Start\" and a routing step value of \"0020\". This value is then filtered using the WHERE clause.\n\nThe second part of the query uses the FIRST function again to retrieve the end time of the first event with a name starting with \"Complete\" and a routing step value of \"0010\". This value is also filtered using the WHERE clause.\n\nThe query then calculates the difference between the two values and takes the average of all the differences using the AVG function.\n\nFinally, the query returns the average value from the SELECT statement.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.
