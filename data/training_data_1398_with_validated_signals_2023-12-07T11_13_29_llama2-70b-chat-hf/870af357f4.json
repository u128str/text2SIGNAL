The first part of the query uses a subquery to retrieve the count of event names:\n\nCOUNT(event_name)\n\nThis subquery retrieves the total number of event names in the 'defaultview-59' table.\n\n2. The second part of the query uses another subquery to retrieve the count of distinct event names:\n\nCOUNT(DISTINCT event_name)\n\nThis subquery retrieves the number of unique event names in the 'defaultview-59' table.\n\n3. The main query then calculates the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names using the following formula:\n\n(COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name)) / COUNT(event_name) * 100\n\nThis formula calculates the percentage of unique event names by subtracting the count of distinct event names from the total count of event names and then dividing the result by the total count of event names. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\n4. Finally, the query selects the calculated percentage from the 'defaultview-59' table:\n\nSELECT SUM(\n(SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name))\n) / SUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n\nThe 'SUM' aggregation function is used to calculate the total percentage across all rows in the table.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\n(SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name))\n)\n/\nSUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
