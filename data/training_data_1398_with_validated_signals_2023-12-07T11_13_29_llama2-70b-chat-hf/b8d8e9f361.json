This indicates that the query is interested in grouping data by PO business unit.\n* The fourth line groups the data by the first and third columns.\n* The fifth line orders the data by the first column in ascending order, with nulls sorted first.\n* The sixth line fills the timeseries function with the quarterly data.\n* The seventh line limits the results to 500 rows.\n\nBased on these observations, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('QUARTER', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME))) AS \"Quarter\",\nSUM (\"PO Item Total Amount\") AS \"PO Item Total Amount\", \n\"PO Business Unit\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\"\nGROUP BY 1,3\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('QUARTER')\nLIMIT 500 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
