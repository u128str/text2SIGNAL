The first part of the query selects the columns \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\" from the table \"FLATTEN(defaultview-124)\". The table name is \"FLATTEN(defaultview-124)\" and the column names are \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\".\n2. The second part of the query applies a filter to the data, only selecting rows where the value in the \"EVENT_NAME\" column is in the list (\"Update PO Item Quantity\"). The column name is \"EVENT_NAME\".\n3. The third part of the query groups the data by the columns \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\". The column names are \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\".\n4. The fourth part of the query selects the columns \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\" from the grouped data. The column names are \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\".\n5. The fifth part of the query applies a filter to the data, only selecting rows where the value in the \"CASE_COUNT\" column is greater than 1. The column name is \"CASE_COUNT\".\n6. The sixth part of the query groups the data by the column \"PO Vendor Name\". The column name is \"PO Vendor Name\".\n7. The seventh part of the query orders the data by the column \"CASE_COUNT\" in descending order. The column name is \"CASE_COUNT\".\n8. The eighth part of the query limits the result to 10 rows.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.
