This is described as \"Retrieve the PR creation date for each month.\"\n* The second part of the query calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the last end time of the 'Receive Invoice' event from the last end time of the 'Pay Invoice' event. This is described as \"Calculate the average cycle time for each month.\"\n* The third part of the query counts the number of PO items for each month. This is described as \"Retrieve the number of PO items for each month.\"\n* The fourth part of the query filters the results to only include events where the 'Receive Invoice' event comes before the 'Pay Invoice' event. This is described as \"Filter the results to only include events where the 'Receive Invoice' event comes before the 'Pay Invoice' event.\"\n* The fifth part of the query orders the results by the first column in ascending order, with null values coming first. This is described as \"Order the results by the first column in ascending order, with null values coming first.\"\n* The final part of the query fills in missing values in the timeseries using the 'MONTH' function.
