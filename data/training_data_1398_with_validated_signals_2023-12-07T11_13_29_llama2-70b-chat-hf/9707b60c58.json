The first part of the query is the SELECT clause, which specifies the columns to be returned. In this case, we are interested in the count of case_id, which is an identifier for each row in the table.\n2. The FILTER clause is used to filter the rows that should be counted. In this case, we only want to count rows where the \"Planned Order Number\" column is null.\n3. The second part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be queried. In this case, we are querying the \"defaultview-183\" table.\n4. Finally, the query calculates the percentage of null \"Planned Order Number\" values by dividing the count of case_id by 100.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as follows:\n\n* \"Get the percentage of null 'Planned Order Number' values in the 'defaultview-183' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
