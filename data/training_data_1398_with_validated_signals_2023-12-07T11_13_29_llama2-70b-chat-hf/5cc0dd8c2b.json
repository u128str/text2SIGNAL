The first part calculates the average time difference between the last and first occurrence of each event:\nAVG( (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)) )\nThis part uses the FIRST and LAST aggregate functions to get the first and last occurrence of each event, and then calculates the time difference between them. The AVG aggregate function is used to calculate the average time difference across all events.\n2. The second part filters out events that have only one occurrence:\nFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\tFROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub)\nThe BOOL_OR aggregate function is used to check if the occurrence of each event is greater than 1. The FILTER clause filters out events that do not meet this condition.\n3. The third part calculates the average time difference for the filtered events:\nAVG( (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)) )\nThis part is similar to the first part, but it only calculates the average time difference for the events that have been filtered.\n4. The final part subtracts the average time difference from the overall average time difference:\n(AVG( (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)) )) - (AVG( (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)) ))\nThis part calculates the difference between the average time difference for the filtered events and the overall average time difference.\n\nThe signal query can be summarized as follows:\n\n* Calculate the average time difference between the last and first occurrence of each event.\n* Filter out events that have only one occurrence.\n* Calculate the average time difference for the filtered events.\n* Subtract the average time difference from the overall average time difference.\n\nThe table name used in the signal query is \"defaultview-59\".
