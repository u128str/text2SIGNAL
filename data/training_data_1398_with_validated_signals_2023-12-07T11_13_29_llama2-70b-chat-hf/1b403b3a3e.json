First, filter the products with fertilizer material type. Then, count the distinct product IDs and divide the result by the total count of distinct product IDs with fertilizer material type. The output is a percentage represented as a decimal value.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its components and describing each part's purpose.\n\n1. SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, \"COUNT(DISTINCT \\\"Product ID\\\")\" and \"COUNT(DISTINCT \\\"Product ID\\\") FILTER(WHERE \\\"Material Type ID\\\" = 'FERT')\".\n2. FILTER clause: The filter clause is used to filter the data based on a condition. In this case, the condition is \"WHERE (SELECT SUM(\\\"Statistical Fcst Qty\\\") = 0)\". This means that only products with zero forecast quantity are included in the analysis.\n3. AND clause: The AND clause is used to apply an additional filter based on the \"Material Type ID\" column. Only products with a material type ID of 'FERT' are included.\n4. COUNT(DISTINCT \\\"Product ID\\\") : This calculates the total number of distinct product IDs in the filtered data.\n5. FILTER(WHERE \\\"Material Type ID\\\" = 'FERT') : This filters the data to only include products with a material type ID of 'FERT'.\n6. * 100 : This multiplies the result by 100 to express the output as a percentage.\n7. FROM clause: The query is applied to the table named \"defaultview-404\".\n\nBy combining these components, we can understand that the SIGNAL query calculates the percentage of fertilizer products with zero forecast quantity.
