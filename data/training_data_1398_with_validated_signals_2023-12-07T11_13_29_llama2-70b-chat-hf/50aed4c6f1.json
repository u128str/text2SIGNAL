SELECT: The query starts by selecting a column from a table.\n2. SUM: The selected column is summed to get a total value.\n3. FILTER: The sum is filtered to only include rows where the event name contains the string 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n4. AND: The filtered sum is then divided by another sum, which is the total amount in global currency for all events with the same name.\n5. * 100: The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n6. FROM: The query specifies the table to use, which is flattened into a single row per event.\n\nThe table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query are:\n\n* Table: FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")\n* Columns:\n\t+ EVENT_NAME\n\t+ ClearingDate\n\t+ NetDueDate\n\t+ AmountInGlobalCurrency\n* Values:\n\t+ 'Clear Accounts Receivable' (used in the FILTER clause)\n\t+ DURATION '1day' (used in the FILTER clause)\n\t+ 100 (used in the multiplication operation)", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (\nSUM (\"AmountInGlobalCurrency\" ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE '%Clear Accounts Receivable%'  \nAND (ClearingDate   - NetDueDate)  > DURATION '1day')  \n/ SUM (\"AmountInGlobalCurrency\" )\nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE '%Clear Accounts Receivable%' )\n) * 100\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
