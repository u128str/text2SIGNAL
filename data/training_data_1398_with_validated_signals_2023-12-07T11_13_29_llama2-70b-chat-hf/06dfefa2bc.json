For each range, it calculates the average total cycle time, number of invoices, invoice amount in USD, and late payment rate in percentage. The query uses a subquery to filter out cases with no invoice clearings.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Signal query starts by selecting five columns from a subquery (SUB1) that calculates the cycle time between creating a goods receipt and receiving an invoice. The subquery uses a nested query to filter out cases where the invoice clearing date is null, indicating that the invoice has not been cleared.\n\nThe outer query (SUB2) groups the results by the first two columns and calculates the average total cycle time, number of invoices, invoice amount in USD, and late payment rate in percentage for each group. The late payment rate is calculated by counting the number of invoices with a clearing date after the due date and dividing it by the total number of invoices.\n\nThe query uses a CASE statement to categorize the cycle time into six ranges and assign a sequence number to each range. The sequence number is then used to calculate the average total cycle time, number of invoices, and invoice amount for each range.\n\nThe final result is a JSON object with a single key, \"signal_description\", that contains a human-readable description of the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Goods Receipt to Invoice Receipt - Cycle Time Range\",\n  \"Avg.
