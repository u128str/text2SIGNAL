This is described as \"Retrieve the last 'Create Invoice' event date for each month\".\n* The second part of the query uses COUNT and FILTER to calculate the number of invoices without payment. This is described as \"Calculate the percentage of invoices without payment\".\n* The third part of the query uses a nested SELECT statement to filter the results by only including months where there are invoices with no payment. This is described as \"Filter the results by only including months where there are invoices with no payment\".\n* Finally, the query uses ORDER BY and NULLS FIRST to sort the results by the invoice creation date in ascending order, and fills any gaps in the data with the previous value. This is not explicitly mentioned in the signal_description, but it is implied by the mention of the \"month\" column in the DATE_TRUNC function.\n\nThe signal_description is written in a style that is easy for a human to understand, with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'MONTH',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Invoice creation date\",\n  COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\n        WHERE\n          (\n            (\n              NOW() > (\"InvoiceDueDate\")\n            )\n            AND (\"InvoiceAccountingClearingDate\" IS NULL)\n          )\n      ) > 0\n  ) / COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Invoice')) * 100 AS \"No Payment Rate\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\"\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
