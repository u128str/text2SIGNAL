In this case, the table is named \"defaultview-124\".\n* Then, we have the WHERE clause, which specifies a condition that must be met for a row to be included in the output. In this case, the condition is that \"PO Item Quantity\" must be different from \"PO Item Total Invoiced Quantity\".\n* Finally, we have the ORDER BY clause, which specifies how the output should be sorted.
