The time differences are calculated using the DURATION function and are grouped into 10 categories: 0-1 days, 1-2 days, 2-3 days, 3-4 days, 4-5 days, 5-6 days, 6-7 days, 7-8 days, 8-9 days, 9-10 days, and >10 days.\n\nThe query is using the \"defaultview-183\" table, and the columns used are \"Actual Delivery Date\", \"Scheduled Finish Date\", and \"Time difference\". The \"Time difference\" column is calculated using a CASE statement that takes into account the time difference between the two dates and assigns a category based on the duration.\n\nThe query is ordered by the \"Time difference\" column in ascending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query and provides a human-readable description of the results, including the table name, column names, and the criteria used for grouping the results.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) as \"Late deliveries\",\n\nCase\n\tWhen \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '1day'\n    THEN '0-1 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '1days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '2days'\n    THEN 'b) 1-2 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '2days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '3days'\n    THEN 'c) 2-3 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '3days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '4days'\n    THEN 'd) 3-4 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '4days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '5days'\n    THEN 'e) 4-5 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '5days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '6days'\n    THEN 'f) 5-6 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '6days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '7days'\n    THEN 'g) 6-7 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '7days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '8days'\n    THEN 'h) 7-8 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '8days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '9days'\n    THEN 'i) 8-9 days'\n    When \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '9days'\n\tAND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" <= Duration '10days'\n    THEN 'j) 9-10 days'\n    ELSE 'k) >10 days'\nEND AS \"Time difference\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'\norder by 2 asc\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
