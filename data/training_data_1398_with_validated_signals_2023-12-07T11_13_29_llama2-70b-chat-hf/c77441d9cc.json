First, we select the count of case IDs using the \"COUNT(case_id)\" function.\n2. Next, we filter the count using a subquery that checks if the occurrence of any event name is greater than 1. The subquery uses the \"BOOL_OR\" function to combine the results of multiple occurrence checks into a single boolean value.\n3. The subquery is wrapped in a \"FROM\" clause to specify the table to use for the subquery. In this case, we use the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n4. Finally, we divide the filtered count by the total count of case IDs and multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage of case IDs with at least two occurrences.\n\nBy describing each step of the query in this way, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that is easy to understand for someone familiar with the table schema and column names.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE\n\t(SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM(SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub\n)\n)/COUNT(case_id)*100\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
