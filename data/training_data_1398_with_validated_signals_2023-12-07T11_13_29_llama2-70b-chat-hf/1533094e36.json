Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from a temporary table named temp.\n\t* The temporary table is created by selecting case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, and end_time from the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") table.\n\t* The selected columns are then transformed using a CASE statement, which calculates the AVG_ClearingTime as the difference between the end time and the first end time of the 'Create Accounts Receivable' event, partitioned by 'ARUniqueKey' and ordered by end time.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts and describing each part:\n\t* The first part of the query is the SELECT clause, which selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from the temporary table temp.\n\t* The second part of the query is the FROM clause, which defines the temporary table temp.\n\t* The third part of the query is the WHERE clause, which filters the rows to only include those where the event_name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable%'.\n3.
