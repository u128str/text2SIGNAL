The COUNT function is applied to the \"BillingDocument\" column, and the DISTINCT keyword is used to count unique values only. The FILTER clause is used to filter the data to only include rows where the \"event_name\" column value is 'Cancel Billing Document'.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve data from the \"defaultview-222\" table.\n2. Count the number of distinct \"BillingDocument\" values.\n3. Filter the data to only include rows where the \"event_name\" value is 'Cancel Billing Document'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should accurately reflect these steps and provide a clear understanding of what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"BillingDocument\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name ='Cancel Billing Document')\n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
