Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: This clause selects the median of a calculation.\n\t* The calculation: This is a subtraction operation between two values.\n\t* The FROM clause: This clause specifies the table to use for the query.\n2. Breaking down the calculation into its parts:\n\t* The first part: This is a subquery that selects the last end time of events named 'Receive Return'.\n\t* The second part: This is a subquery that selects the first end time of events named 'Create Return Request'.\n3. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t* event_name: 'Receive Return' and 'Create Return Request'\n\t* end_time: The last end time and the first end time of the respective events.\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* Using simple language to explain the calculation, e.g., \"Calculate the median of the differences between...\"\n\t* Including the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nMEDIAN(\n\t\t\t   (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\t\t    WHERE event_name = 'Receive Return')\n\t\t\t    -\n               (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n                WHERE event_name = 'Create Return Request')\n                )\nFROM \"defaultview-2\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
