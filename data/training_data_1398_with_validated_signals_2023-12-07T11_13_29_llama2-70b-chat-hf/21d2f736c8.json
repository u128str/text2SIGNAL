Then, it is dividing this count by the total number of cases and multiplying the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nThe query uses the \"defaultview-217\" table, which suggests that the data is related to customer service or ticketing system. The query is using two columns: \"case_id\" and \"event_name\". \"case_id\" is used to identify each case, and \"event_name\" is used to identify the type of event that occurred for each case.\n\nThe query first filters the data to only include cases where the event name is \"Change Status to In Progress\". This is done using a subquery that counts the number of events with this name and filters the results to only include cases where this count is greater than 1.\n\nThen, the query calculates the percentage of cases that match this filter by dividing the count of cases that have the status changed to \"In Progress\" by the total number of cases. This result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFinally, the query returns the percentage as a single value, which is represented as a JSON object with a single key, \"signal_description\", and a value that is a human-readable description of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) \nFILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 1 )\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\nWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) \nWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 0 )\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
