{"signal_description": "Retrieve the average cycle time for receiving and reconciling invoices in the last quarter, grouped by PO Item Line Type.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the average cycle time for receiving and reconciling invoices in the last quarter, grouped by PO Item Line Type.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. First, we identify the table name, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n2. We note that the query uses three columns: DATE_TRUNC, AVG, and \"PO Item Line Type\".\n3. We recognize that DATE_TRUNC is a function used to truncate a date to a specific interval, in this case, 'QUARTER'.\n4. We see that the argument for DATE_TRUNC is a subquery that selects the last END_TIME value.\n5. We then look at the AVG column, which calculates the average of a subquery that filters the END_TIME values based on the EVENT_NAME being 'Reconcile invoice' and subtracts the FIRST END_TIME value for the same query.\n6. Finally, we note that the last column is simply a string literal, \"PO Item Line Type\".\n7. With this information, we can construct the signal_description, which summarizes the purpose of the SIGNAL query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining the following parts:\n\n* \"Retrieve the average cycle time for receiving and reconciling invoices\" - This describes the main purpose of the query.\n* \"in the last quarter\" - This refers to the use of DATE_TRUNC to truncate the date to the last quarter.\n* \"grouped by PO Item Line Type\" - This indicates that the results will be grouped by the \"PO Item Line Type\" column.\n\nThe final signal_description is a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, providing context and clarity to the user.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('QUARTER', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME))) AS \"Quarter\", \nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Reconcile invoice') - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Receive invoice')) AS \"Avg.
