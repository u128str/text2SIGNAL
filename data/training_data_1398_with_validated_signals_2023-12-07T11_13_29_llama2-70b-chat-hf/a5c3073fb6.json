Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Identifying the column names: \"PO Vendor Name\", \"END_TIME\", \"EVENT_NAME\"\n3. Understanding the query logic:\n\t* The query filters the rows where the difference between the last \"END_TIME\" value of the \"Release PO\" event and the first \"END_TIME\" value of the \"Create PO Item\" event is greater than 3 days.\n\t* The query then counts the number of unique \"PO Vendor Name\" values in the filtered rows.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* We started by mentioning the table name, \"defaultview-124\".\n\t* Then, we described the column names and respective values that are used in the query: \"PO Vendor Name\", \"END_TIME\", and \"EVENT_NAME\".\n\t* Next, we explained the query logic in a human-readable format, using phrases like \"where the difference between...\", \"is greater than 3 days\", and \"count the number of unique...\".\n\t* Finally, we wrapped the description in curly braces to match the expected JSON format.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(\"PO Vendor Name\")\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - \n(SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item') > DURATION '3DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
