{"signal_description": "This signal monitors the automation rate of three business processes: Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment. For Purchase Order, the automation rate is calculated by dividing the number of purchase orders created by the system or service user type by the total number of purchase orders. For Invoice, the automation rate is calculated by dividing the number of invoices created by the system or service user type by the total number of invoices. For Payment, the automation rate is calculated by dividing the number of payment proposals or payment postings created by the system or service user type by the total number of payment proposals or payment postings. The signal outputs 'Automation rate is above 70%. No action needed' if the automation rate is above 70%, 'Automation rate is between 30% and 70%. Potential for improvement' if the automation rate is between 30% and 70%, and 'Automation rate is below 30%. Improvement highly recommended' if the automation rate is below 30%.

The signal uses the 'Event Created By User Type' column to determine if the event was created by a system or service user type.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe signal is constructed by using three separate CASE statements, one for each business process (Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment). Each CASE statement calculates the automation rate for its respective business process by dividing the number of events created by the system or service user type by the total number of events. The automation rate is then compared to three threshold values (0.7, 0.3, and 0.3) to determine the output message. The output message is then combined into a single JSON object with the key \"signal_description\".\n\nThe signal uses the \"Event Created By User Type\" column to determine if the event was created by a system or service user type. This column is used in the Filter clause of the SELECT statements to filter out events that were not created by the system or service user type.\n\nThe signal also uses the \"COUNT(Distinct ...)\" function to count the number of unique \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\" values for each business process. This is necessary because the signal needs to count the number of events that were created by the system or service user type, rather than the total number of events.\n\nOverall, the signal is designed to provide a high-level overview of the automation rate of three business processes, and to alert users if the automation rate falls below a certain threshold.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n-- Purchase Order\nCASE\n\tWHEN(SUM((SELECT COUNT(Distinct \"Inv.
