signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its component parts and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n* The first part of the query selects the columns that are needed in the output: \"PO Item Category\", \"PO Item Line Type\", \"PO Item Supplier ID\", \"Number of PO Item\", \"Number of PO Line item\", \"Total Spend $\", \"Total Open Invoice Amount $\", \"Average Cycle Time\", and \"Received Discount $\".\n* The second part of the query filters the data to only include rows where \"PO Item Line Type\" is in ('Catalog','NonCatalog') AND \"PO Item Supplier ID\" IS NOT NULL AND \"PO Item Line Type\" IS NOT NULL.\n* The third part of the query groups the data by \"PO Item Category\", \"PO Item Line Type\", and \"PO Item Supplier ID\".\n* The fourth part of the query orders the data by the \"Total Spend $\" column in descending order, with null values appearing last.\n* The fifth part of the query performs calculations on the data, including counting the number of distinct \"PO Item ID\" and \"case_id\", summing the \"PO Item Total Amount\" and \"Last Invoice Item Amount\", and calculating the average cycle time by subtracting the last event time of \"Create PO Item\" from the last event time of \"Receive PO Item\".\n* Finally, the query filters the data to only include rows where the \"Last Invoice Payment Date\" is null and the \"Last Invoice Due Date\" is less than the current day for the \"Total Open Invoice Amount $\" calculation.\n\nThe signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query,
