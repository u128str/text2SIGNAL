In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The next part of the query is the AVG() function, which calculates the average value of the expression that follows.\n* The expression is a subtraction of two values, both of which are obtained using the SELECT clause. The first value is the last 'end_time' value for events with the name 'Create Invoice', while the second value is the first 'end_time' value for events with the name 'Record Goods Issue'.\n* The FROM clause specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-59\" table.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the table to use: \"defaultview-59\"\n2. Identify the column(s) to use in the calculation: 'end_time'\n3. Identify the event names to filter: 'Create Invoice' and 'Record Goods Issue'\n4. Calculate the time difference between the last 'Create Invoice' event and the first 'Record Goods Issue' event for each process instance in the table.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes these steps in a human-readable format, explicitly referencing the table name, column names, and event names used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n        (SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create Invoice'))\n        -\n        (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Record Goods Issue'))\n)\n\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
