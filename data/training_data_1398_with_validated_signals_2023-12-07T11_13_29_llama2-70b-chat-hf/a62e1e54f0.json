The first part of the query is SELECT, which specifies the columns to be returned in the output.\n2. The second part is COUNT(EVENT_NAME), which counts the number of events with the name \"Create Process Order\".\n3. The third part is FILTER(WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog')), which filters the events to only those where the user type is not \"Dialog\".\n4. The fourth part is COUNT(EVENT_NAME) / (COUNT(EVENT_NAME)) * 100, which calculates the percentage of automated process orders created by users who are not dialog users.\n5. The fifth part is AS \"% Automation Create Process Order\", which gives an alias to the calculated percentage.\n6. The sixth part is COUNT(EVENT_NAME) AS \"# Create Process Order\", which counts the total number of process orders created.\n7. The seventh part is Division, which specifies the column to be used for grouping the results.\n8. The eighth part is FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\"), which specifies the table to be used for the query.\n9. The ninth part is WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order', which filters the events to only those with the name \"Create Process Order\".\n10. The tenth part is GROUP BY 2, which groups the results by the second column (Division).\n11. The eleventh part is ORDER BY 1 desc, which sorts the results in descending order based on the first column (% Automation Create Process Order).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog'))) / (COUNT (EVENT_NAME)) * 100 AS \"% Automation Create Process Order\", \nCOUNT(EVENT_NAME) AS \"# Create Process Order\",\n\"Division\"\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\nWHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order'\n-- GROUP BY 2\nORDER BY 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
