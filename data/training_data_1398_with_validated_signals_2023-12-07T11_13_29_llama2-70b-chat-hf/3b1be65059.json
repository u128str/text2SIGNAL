The COUNT function is applied to the DISTINCT function, which removes any duplicate case IDs from the result set.\n\nThe FILTER clause is used to filter the results based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the value in the 'Change Type' column must be 'Update'. The BOOL_OR function is used to convert the value in the 'Change Type' column to a boolean value, and the ILIKE operator is used to match the value against the string 'Update'. The parentheses around the SELECT statement are used to ensure that the filter condition is applied to the result of the SELECT statement.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the main components of the query, including the table name, column names, and filter condition.
