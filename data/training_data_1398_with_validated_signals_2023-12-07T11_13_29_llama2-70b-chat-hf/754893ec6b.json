It selects the sum of the \"BillingRequest_TotalCount\" column from the \"defaultview-197\" table.\n\nTo create the human-readable description, we can start by identifying the key elements of the query:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-197\"\n* Column name: \"BillingRequest_TotalCount\"\n* Aggregation function: SUM\n\nWe can then construct the description by combining these elements into a natural language sentence. Here's one possible way to do it:\n\n\"Retrieve the total count of billing requests from the 'defaultview-197' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name and column name, making it clear what data is being queried. It also mentions the aggregation function used (SUM), which helps to further clarify the purpose of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\"BillingRequest_TotalCount\")\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
