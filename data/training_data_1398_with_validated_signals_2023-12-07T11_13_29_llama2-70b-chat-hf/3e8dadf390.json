This is described as \"Calculate the average cycle time for invoices\".\n* The second part of the query selects the PO category, which is determined by whether the last PO Id is null or not. If it is null, then the PO category is 'Non-PO Invoice', otherwise it's 'PO Invoice'. This is described as \"Grouped by PO category\".\n* The third part of the query filters the results to only include invoices where the last payment clearing date is not null and the event name matches either 'Post Invoice' or 'Clear Invoice'. This is described as \"Filter the results to only include invoices with a payment clearing date and an event name of either 'Post Invoice' or 'Clear Invoice'\".\n* The fourth part of the query groups the results by PO category and orders them by average cycle time in descending order. This is described as \"Grouped by PO category and ordered by average cycle time in descending order\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the query without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice'))) \n         AS \"Average Cycle Time\",\n        \n   CASE WHEN \n   \t\"Last PO Id\" IS NULL \n    \tTHEN 'Non-PO Invoice' \n        ELSE 'PO Invoice' \n        END AS \"PO Category\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\n  \nWHERE 'Last Payment Clearing Date' IS NOT NULL\nAND \"event_name\" MATCHES ('Post Invoice'~> 'Clear Invoice')\n\nGROUP BY 2\nORDER BY 1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
