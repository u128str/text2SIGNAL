It then uses two case statements to create the 'PO Release Cycle Time Range' and 'Sequence No' columns.\n\nThe first case statement checks the value of the 'CYCLE_TIME' column and assigns a value to the 'PO Release Cycle Time Range' column based on the following criteria:\n\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is less than or equal to 3 days, the value is '0 - 3 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 3 days and less than 5 days, the value is '4 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 5 days and less than 11 days, the value is '5 - 10 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 11 days and less than 16 days, the value is '11 - 15 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 16 days and less than 21 days, the value is '16 - 20 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 21 days and less than 31 days, the value is '21 - 30 Days'\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 31 days, the value is 'More than 30 Days'\n\nThe second case statement checks the value of the 'CYCLE_TIME' column and assigns a unique number to each group based on the following criteria:\n\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is less than or equal to 3 days, the value is 0\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 3 days and less than 5 days, the value is 1\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 5 days and less than 11 days, the value is 2\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 11 days and less than 16 days, the value is 3\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 16 days and less than 21 days, the value is 4\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 21 days and less than 31 days, the value is 5\n* If 'CYCLE_TIME' is greater than 31 days, the value is 6\n\nThe query then groups the data by the 'PO Release Cycle Time Range' and 'Sequence No' columns, and calculates the total number of cases, total PO amount, and average cycle time for each group. Finally, the query filters out any rows where the 'CYCLE_TIME' column is less than or equal to 3 days.\n\nThe resulting data is a table with the following columns:\n\n* 'PO Release Cycle Time Range'\n* 'Sequence No'\n* 'No. of Cases'\n* 'Total PO Amount (INR)'\n* 'Avg. Cycle Time'\n\nThe query output is in JSON format, with a single object containing the 'signal_description' property, which contains a human-readable description of the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"PO Release Cycle Time Range\",\n\"No. of Cases\",\n \"Total PO Amount (INR)\",\n \"Avg.
