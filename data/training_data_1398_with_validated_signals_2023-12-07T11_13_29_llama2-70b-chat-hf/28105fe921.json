SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. COUNT (case_id): The first part of the query is counting the number of rows in the table where the column case_id exists.\n3. FILTER (WHERE ((SELECT COUNT (event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Technically Completed')) < 2) ): The second part of the query is filtering the rows where the count of the event_name column is less than 2 and the value of the event_name column is in the list ('Technically Completed').\n4. COUNT (case_id): The third part of the query is counting the number of rows in the table where the column case_id exists.\n5. /: The fourth part of the query is dividing the result of the second part by the result of the third part.\n6. * 100: The final part of the query is multiplying the result of the division by 100.\n7. FROM \"defaultview-545\": The last part of the query is specifying the table name \"defaultview-545\" from which the data should be selected.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as selecting the percentage of case_id where the count of event_name is less than 2 and event_name is in ('Technically Completed') from the 'defaultview-545' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(COUNT (case_id) FILTER(WHERE ((SELECT COUNT (event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Technically Completed')) < 2) ))\n/ \nCOUNT (case_id) )*100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
