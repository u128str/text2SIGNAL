This part counts the number of case IDs that have the 'Clear Invoice' event and filters out any case IDs that have any of the specified dunning, payment, or invoice reversal events.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES('Clear Invoice'))\". This part counts the total number of case IDs that have the 'Clear Invoice' event.\n* The third part of the query is \"/ (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES('Clear Invoice'))\". This part divides the number of case IDs that have 'Clear Invoice' event by the total number of case IDs that have any event related to dunning, payment, or invoice reversal.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"* 100\". This part multiplies the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nBy combining these parts, we can understand that the SIGNAL query retrieves the percentage of cleared invoices out of all invoices that have been processed, by counting the number of case IDs that have 'Clear Invoice' event and dividing it by the total number of case IDs that have any event related to dunning, payment, or invoice reversal, and then multiplying the result by 100.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE NOT (event_name MATCHES  (('Remove Dunning Block'\n    \t\t|'Set Dunning Block'|'Change Dunning Block'|'Send 1st Overdue Notice'\n    \t\t|'Update Baseline Date'|'Update Payment Term'|'Reverse Invoice'))) \n    \tAND (event_name MATCHES('Clear Invoice'))\n\t)\n/ (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES('Clear Invoice'))\n\t)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
