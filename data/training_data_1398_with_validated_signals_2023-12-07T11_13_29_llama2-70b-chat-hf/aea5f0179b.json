The first part of the query is SELECT, which retrieves the required columns from the table. The columns retrieved are \"# Changes per case\" and \"AVG Cycle Time\".\n2. The next part of the query is FROM, which specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, the table is \"defaultview-383\".\n3. The query then uses a subquery to calculate the \"# Changes per case\" and \"CycleTime\" values. The subquery first filters the unique event IDs for updates using the WHERE clause.\n4. The filtered data is then used to calculate the average number of changes per case using the AVG function.\n5. The subquery then calculates the cycle time by subtracting the first end time from the last end time.\n6. The final part of the query is the TABLESAMPLE clause, which samples exactly 100 rows of data from the table and repeats the sampling with seed 123.\n\nBy describing each part of the query in a human-readable format, we can understand what the query is doing and what data it is retrieving.
