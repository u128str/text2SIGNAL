Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-124\".\n2. Identifying the column names used in the query:\n\t* EVENT_NAME\n\t* END_TIME\n3. Understanding the query logic:\n\t* The query calculates the average time difference between the 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' events.\n\t* It uses two subqueries to retrieve the first 'END_TIME' value of the 'Create PO Item' event and the last 'END_TIME' value of the 'Release PO' event.\n\t* The time difference is calculated by subtracting the first 'END_TIME' value from the last 'END_TIME' value.\n\t* The result is then wrapped in an AVG() function to calculate the average time difference across all records in the table.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed in a human-readable format, with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description includes the calculation logic and the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average time difference between the two events in the 'defaultview-124' table.\n\nNote: The signal_description is not a direct copy-paste of the SIGNAL query, but rather a human-readable summary of the query's logic and purpose.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - \n(SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item'))\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
