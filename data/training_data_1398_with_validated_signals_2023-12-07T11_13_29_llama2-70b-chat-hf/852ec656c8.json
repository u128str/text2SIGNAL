In this case, we are only interested in the count of events.\n* `COUNT(event_name)`: This clause counts the number of events that have a name specified in the `event_name` column. The `COUNT` function is applied to the `event_name` column, which means that we want to count the number of unique values in that column.\n* `FROM \"defaultview-124\"`: This clause specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, we are using a table named `\"defaultview-124\"`.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows:\n\n\"Counting the number of events with name 'event_name' in the 'defaultview-124' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column name, and respective value (i.e., `event_name`) used in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(event_name) FROM \"defaultview-124\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
