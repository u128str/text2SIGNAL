The first part of the query selects three columns: \"Avg. Cycle Time\", \"Avg. Inv. Payment Time\", and \"PO Plant\".\n2. The second part of the query is a subquery that calculates the average cycle time and average inventory payment time using aggregation functions (AVG) and subqueries.\n3. The subquery selects two columns, \"Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.\" and \"PO Item Plant Name\", and calculates the sum of the former and uses the latter to filter the results.\n4. The subquery is ordered by the third column, \"PO Plant\", in descending order.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a set of instructions that summarize the main components of the query. The instructions include the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
