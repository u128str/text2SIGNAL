Calculate the difference between the last end time of 'Receive Invoice' and the first end time of 'Create PO Item' for each month. Display the monthly average cycle time and the corresponding PO creation date.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its key components and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n1. SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"PO Creation Date\" and \"Average cycle time\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"PO Creation Date\", is calculated using the DATE_TRUNC function with the 'month' parameter and the first end time of events with the name 'Create PO Item'. This means that the first end time of each month is selected for the 'Create PO Item' events.\n3. FILTER clause:\nThe second column, \"Average cycle time\", is calculated using the FILTER clause to filter the events with the name 'Receive Invoice' and then calculates the difference between the last end time of these events and the first end time of the 'Create PO Item' events. The AVG aggregation function is used to calculate the average cycle time for each month.\n4. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n5. WHERE clause:\nThe events that match the names 'Create PO Item' and 'Receive Invoice' are selected.\n6. ORDER BY clause:\nThe results are sorted by the first column in ascending order, with NULL values placed first.\n7. FILL TIMESERIES function:\nThe FILL TIMESERIES function is used to fill in missing values in the time series data.\n8. NULL clause:\nThe NULL clause is used to specify that NULL values should be placed first in the sorted results.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and functionality.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"PO Creation Date\",\n    \n    AVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Receive Invoice')))\n   \t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"Average cycle time\"\n    \nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Receive Invoice')\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
