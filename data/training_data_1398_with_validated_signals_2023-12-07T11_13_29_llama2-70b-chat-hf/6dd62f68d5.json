Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: `count(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds') / count(case_id)`\n\t* The FROM clause: `\"defaultview-183\"`\n\t* The WHERE clause: `\"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL`\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its parts:\n\t* `count(case_id)`: Counts the number of rows in the table where the `case_id` column is not null.\n\t* `FILTER (WHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds')`: Filters the rows to only include those where the difference between the `Actual Delivery Date` and `Scheduled Finish Date` columns is greater than zero seconds.\n\t* `/ count(case_id)`: Divides the result of the filter by the total number of rows in the table where the `case_id` column is not null.\n3.
