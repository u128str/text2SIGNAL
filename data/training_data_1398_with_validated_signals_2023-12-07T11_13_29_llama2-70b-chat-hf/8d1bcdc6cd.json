Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects three columns: \"PR Creation Date\", \"AVG Cycle Time\", and \"No of. PO Items\".\n\t* The query uses the \"defaultview-431\" table.\n\t* The query filters for events named 'Create PR Item' and 'Pay Invoice'.\n\t* The query orders the results by the \"PR Creation Date\" column in ascending order with nulls first.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The first part of the query selects the \"DATE_TRUNC\" function with the \"MONTH\" parameter and filters the results using the \"LAST\" function and the \"FILTER\" clause. This part extracts the last end time of each month for events named 'Create PR Item'.\n\t* The second part of the query uses the \"AVG\" function to calculate the average cycle time. It subtracts the last end time of 'Create PR Item' from the last end time of 'Pay Invoice' for each case.\n\t* The third part of the query uses the \"COUNT\" function to count the number of PO items for each quarter.\n3. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t* The query uses the following columns:\n\t\t+ \"END_TIME\" (used in the \"LAST\" function)\n\t\t+ \"EVENT_NAME\" (used in the \"FILTER\" clause)\n\t\t+ \"CASE_ID\" (used in the \"COUNT\" function)\n\t* The query uses the following values:\n\t\t+ 'Create PR Item' and 'Pay Invoice' (used in the \"FILTER\" clause)\n\t\t+ \"MONTH\" (used in the \"DATE_TRUNC\" function)\n\t\t+ \"QUARTER\" (used in the \"FILL\" function)\n4.
