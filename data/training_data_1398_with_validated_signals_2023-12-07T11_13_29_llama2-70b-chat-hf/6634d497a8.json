Item Clearing Date' is not null and the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is before the current day.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its component parts and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n* SELECT: The query starts by selecting a column or columns from a table. In this case, the column selected is COUNT(\"case_id\"), which returns the count of distinct case IDs.\n* FILTER: The query then applies a filter to the selected column(s). The filter is defined using the WHERE clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set.\n* WHERE: The WHERE clause specifies two conditions: (\"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" IS NOT NULL) and (\"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())). The first condition ensures that only rows with a non-null value in the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" column are included, while the second condition ensures that only rows with a \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" that is before the current day are included.\n* FROM: The query specifies the table to query, which is \"defaultview-133\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as retrieving the count of distinct case IDs from the 'defaultview-133' table where the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' is not null and the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is before the current day.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
