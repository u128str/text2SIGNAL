AVG: The query uses the AVG aggregation function, which calculates the average of a set of values.\n3. (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Confirmed')): This part of the query selects the first row where the 'event_name' column has the value 'Confirmed' and returns the value of the 'end_time' column.\n4. - (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Released')): This part of the query selects the last row where the 'event_name' column has the value 'Released' and returns the value of the 'end_time' column.\n5. FROM \"defaultview-183\": This part of the query specifies the table from which the data should be selected, which is \"defaultview-183\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as calculating the average of the differences between the first 'Confirmed' event's end time and the last 'Released' event's end time in the 'defaultview-183' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Confirmed'))\n    -\n    (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Released'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
