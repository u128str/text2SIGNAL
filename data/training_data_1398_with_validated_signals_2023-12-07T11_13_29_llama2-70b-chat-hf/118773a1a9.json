Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: AVG(DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") - \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\")\n\t* FILTER clause: DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\" AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-57\"\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\"): Truncates the \"Last GR Creation Date\" column to the day level.\n\t* \"-\" : Subtracts the \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\" column from the truncated \"Last GR Creation Date\" column.\n\t* AVG(): Calculates the average of the resulting differences.\n3. Breaking down the FILTER clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\": Filters the rows where the last GR creation date is after the last requested delivery date.\n\t* AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes': Filters the rows where the delivery completion status is 'Yes'.\n4. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-57\"\n\t* Column names: \"Last GR Creation Date\", \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\", \"PO Item Delivery Completed\"\n5. Constructing the signal_description by combining the components:\n\t* Start with a brief description of the calculation: \"Calculate the average number of days between the last GR creation date and the last requested delivery date\"\n\t* Add the filter conditions: \"only considering items where the delivery completion status is 'Yes' and the last GR creation date is after the last requested delivery date.\"\n\t* Mention the table name and column names: \"for each PO item in the 'defaultview-57' table\"\n\t* Use a concise language to make it easy to understand: \"Calculate the average number of days between the last GR creation date and the last requested delivery date for each PO item, only considering items where the delivery completion status is 'Yes' and the last GR creation date is after the last requested delivery date.\"\n\nThis signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and logic behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG(DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") - \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\") FILTER (\n      WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\"\n      AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n      )\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
