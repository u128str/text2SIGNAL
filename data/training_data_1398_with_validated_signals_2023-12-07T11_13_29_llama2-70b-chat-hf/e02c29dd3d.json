The FILTER clause is used to filter the events based on their Event Name.\n* Following that, we have the minus sign (-) operator, which indicates that we want to subtract the first End Time of events with names 'Receive Invoice' from the last End Time of events with names 'Pay Invoice'.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table name \"defaultview-431\" as the source of the data.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Calculate the average of the difference between the last End Time of events with names 'Pay Invoice' and the first End Time of events with names 'Receive Invoice' in the 'defaultview-431' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-431\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
