In this case, we are selecting the average of a calculation.\n* Next, we have the calculation itself, which is enclosed in parentheses. This calculation involves subtracting the first end time of events with names 'Create Sales Order Item' from the last end time of events with names 'Create Outbound Delivery'.\n* The WHERE clause filters the events to only those with names 'Create Outbound Delivery' and 'Create Sales Order Item'.\n* The NOW() function returns the current timestamp, and the LAST() function returns the last end time of the events that match the filter.\n* The DURATION '600days' specifies that the events must have occurred within the last 600 days.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-290\" table.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that clearly explains what the query is doing and which table and columns it uses.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Outbound Delivery') AND\n\t\t((NOW() - LAST(end_time)) < DURATION '600days')\n\t\t)\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Sales Order Item')\n\t\t)\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-290\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
