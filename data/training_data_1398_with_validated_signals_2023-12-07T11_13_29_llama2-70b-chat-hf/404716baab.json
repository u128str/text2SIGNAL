The first part of the query selects the case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, BillingDocument, event_name, and end_time from the \"defaultview-197\" table. This is done using the FLATTEN function, which flattens the data from the table into a format that can be used for further processing.\n2. The next part of the query uses a CASE statement to create a new column called AVG_ClearingTime. This column is calculated by taking the difference between the end time of the 'Create Billing Request (DMR)' event and the first end time of the same event, and then averaging it across all billing documents that have the same event name, ordered by end time. This calculation is done using the FILTER and OVER clauses, which allow us to filter the data based on the event name and partition it by billing document.\n3. The final part of the query selects the AVG_ClearingTime column from the temporary table created in step 2 and filters the data to only include rows where the event name is 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\nBy describing each step of the query in this way, we can create a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query that clearly explains what the query is doing and what data it is operating on.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \nBillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) \nFILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Billing Request (DMR)') \nOVER (PARTITION BY BillingDocument ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
