This indicates that the query is selecting a count of distinct values from a column named \"case_id\".\n* The next part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-225'\". This indicates that the query is operating on a table named \"defaultview-225\".\n* The third part of the query is \"WHERE event_name MATCHES('Post Invoice' ~> 'Update PO Payment Terms')\". This indicates that the query is filtering the results to only include rows where the value in the \"event_name\" column matches a specific pattern. The pattern is defined using the MATCHES operator, which allows for regular expression matching. In this case, the pattern is 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Update PO Payment Terms'.\n\nPutting all of these parts together, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id)\nFROM \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES('Post Invoice' ~> 'Update PO Payment Terms') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
