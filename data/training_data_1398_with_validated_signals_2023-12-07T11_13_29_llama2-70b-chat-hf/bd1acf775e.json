The query uses a CASE statement to determine the time frame based on the difference between the scheduled and actual release dates. The time frames are defined using DURATION literals, which allow for human-readable definitions of time intervals.\n\nThe query is then ordered by the \"Time difference\" column in ascending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as \"Select count(case_id) as 'Early releases', ...\" followed by the CASE statement and the conditions for each time frame. The table name and column names are explicitly referenced in the description, making it clear which columns are used in the query.", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
