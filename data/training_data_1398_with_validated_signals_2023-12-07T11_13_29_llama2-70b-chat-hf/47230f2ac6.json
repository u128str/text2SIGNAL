The query is designed to calculate the average time difference between two specific events in a process instance.\n\nThe query starts by selecting the AVG (average) of a subquery that computes the time difference between the last 'Create FI Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance. The subquery uses the LAST and FIRST aggregate functions to retrieve the desired timestamps, and the FILTER clause to filter the events based on their names.\n\nThe outer SELECT clause then filters the process instances to only those where the EVENT_NAME matches either 'Create PO Item' or 'Create FI Invoice'.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. It explains the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average time difference between the two specific events in the 'defaultview-124' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create FI Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))\n        \nFROM \"defaultview-124\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Create FI Invoice')\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
