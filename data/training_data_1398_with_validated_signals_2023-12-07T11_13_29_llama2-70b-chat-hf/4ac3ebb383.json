Item Cash Discount Days 1' column is either null or equal to zero.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query provided is a SELECT statement with a COUNT aggregation function and a FILTER clause. The FILTER clause has two conditions:\n\n1. \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL\n2. \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0\n\nThe query is selecting the count of distinct case IDs (represented by the \"CASE_ID\" column) from the \"defaultview-225\" table. The FILTER clause is applying two filters to the data:\n\n1. The first filter is checking if the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" column is null. If it is null, then the row is included in the result set.\n2. The second filter is checking if the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" column is equal to zero. If it is equal to zero, then the row is included in the result set.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should accurately reflect the conditions specified in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"Last Inv.
