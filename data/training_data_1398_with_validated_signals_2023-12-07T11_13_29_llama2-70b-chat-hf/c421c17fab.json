Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: AVG (\"ClearingDate\" - \"DocumentDate\")\n\t* FILTER clause: WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Accounts Receivable'\n\t* FROM clause: FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n\t* WHERE clause: \"ClearingDate\" IS NOT NULL AND \"NetDueDate\" IS NOT NULL\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* AVG: Average\n\t* (\"ClearingDate\" - \"DocumentDate\"): Calculate the difference between the clearing date and document date\n3. Identifying the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table name: defaultview-197\n\t* Column names: ClearingDate, DocumentDate, NetDueDate, EVENT_NAME\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query, using the identified components and table/column names:\n\t* \"Calculate the average clearing time for accounts receivable.\"\n\t* \"Clearing time is calculated by subtracting the document date from the clearing date.\"\n\t* \"The calculation is performed on the defaultview-197 table.\"\n\t* \"The clearing date and net due date are not null.\"\n5. Combining the description components into a single string, using proper grammar and punctuation:\n\t* \"Calculate the average clearing time for accounts receivable.
