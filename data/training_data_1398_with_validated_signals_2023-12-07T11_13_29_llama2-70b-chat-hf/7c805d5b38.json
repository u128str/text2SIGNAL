Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query calculates a ratio of two counts of case IDs.\n\t* The first count filters cases where the last GR creation date is after the PO requested delivery date and the PO delivery status is Received.\n\t* The second count filters cases where the PO delivery status is Received.\n\t* The ratio is then multiplied by 100.\n2. Understanding the table name and column schema:\n\t* The query uses the table \"defaultview-545\".\n\t* The table has columns \"case_id\", \"Last GR Creation Date\", \"PO Requested Delivery Date\", and \"PO Delivery Status\".\n3. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The description starts with a brief summary of the calculation, stating the purpose of the query.\n\t* The description then breaks down the calculation into its components, referring to the relevant table columns and filter conditions.\n\t* The description concludes by stating the final calculation, which is the ratio of received POs with a delivery date after the last GR creation date, out of all received POs.\n\nThe signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and logic behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(1 - \n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Requested Delivery Date\"\n\t\t\tAND \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'\n\t\t)\n\t/\n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'\n\t\t)\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
