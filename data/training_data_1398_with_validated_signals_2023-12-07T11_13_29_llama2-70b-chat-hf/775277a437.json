SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, \"Percentage of Billing Documents cancelled\" and \"Project Type\".\n2. CASE clause: The query uses a CASE clause to calculate the \"Percentage of Billing Documents cancelled\" column. The CASE clause checks if the result of dividing the percentage of billing documents cancelled by 1 is greater than or equal to 0.5, and if so, it returns the percentage of billing documents cancelled minus the result of dividing the percentage of billing documents cancelled by 1 plus 1. Otherwise, it returns the percentage of billing documents cancelled minus the result of dividing the percentage of billing documents cancelled by 1.\n3. FROM clause: The query uses a subquery to select data from the \"defaultview-197\" table. The subquery calculates the percentage of billing documents cancelled and project type.\n4. ORDER BY clause: The query orders the results by the \"Percentage of Billing Documents cancelled\" column in descending order.\n\nThe signal_description includes references to the table name (\"defaultview-197\"), column names (\"Percentage of Billing Documents cancelled\", \"Project Type\"), and respective values (e.g., \"Cancel Billing Document\", \"Create Billing Document\").
