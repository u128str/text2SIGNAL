{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of unique case IDs from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT COUNT(case_id) FROM \"defaultview-545\"` can be broken down into several parts:\n\n* `SELECT`: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* `COUNT(case_id)`: This function counts the number of unique values in the `case_id` column.\n* `FROM`: This keyword indicates that we are specifying the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n* `\"defaultview-545\"`: This is the name of the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as: \"Retrieve the count of unique case IDs from the 'defaultview-545' table.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column name, and respective value (i.e., the count of unique case IDs).\n\nTherefore, the output result in JSON format would be:\n\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of unique case IDs from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
