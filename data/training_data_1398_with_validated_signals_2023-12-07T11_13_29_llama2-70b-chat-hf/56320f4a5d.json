The `count()` function takes an argument, which in this case is `case_id`.\n* `FROM`: This keyword indicates that we are specifying the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n* `\"defaultview-545\"`: This is the name of the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the main aspects of the query, which are:\n\n* The table name: `\"defaultview-545\"`\n* The column name: `case_id`\n* The operation: `count()`\n\nThe signal_description should read like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, columns schema, and respective values.
