DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"PO Creation Date\"\nThis part of the query extracts the first 'Create PO Item' event's end time for each month. The DATE_TRUNC function truncates the date to the first day of the month, and the FIRST function selects the first 'Create PO Item' event's end time for each group of rows that have the same month.\n2. \"PO Item Line Type\" AS \"PO Item Line Type\"\nThis part of the query selects the \"PO Item Line Type\" column from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n3. SUM (\"PO Item Total Amount\") AS \"PO Item Amount\"\nThis part of the query calculates the total amount of PO items by summing up the \"PO Item Total Amount\" column for each group of rows that have the same month and line type.\n4. FROM \"defaultview-545\"\nThis part of the query specifies the table to use for the query.\n5. GROUP BY 1,2\nThis part of the query groups the rows by the first and second columns (i.e., \"PO Creation Date\" and \"PO Item Line Type\").\n6. ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nThis part of the query sorts the results by the \"PO Creation Date\" column in ascending order, with null values appearing first.\n7. FILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL\nThis part of the query fills in missing values in the time series data using the 'MONTH' interval.\n8. LIMIT 25\nThis part of the query limits the number of rows returned in the result set to 25.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and functionality.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))))  AS \"PO Creation Date\",\n \"PO Item Line Type\" AS \"PO Item Line Type\", SUM (\"PO Item Total Amount\") AS \"PO Item Amount\"\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nGROUP BY 1,2\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL\nLIMIT 25 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
