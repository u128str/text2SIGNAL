In this case, we have one column, \"Avg. Cycle Time,\" which is calculated using two subqueries.\n* The first subquery uses the SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice' clause to find the last event time for 'Clear Invoice'. The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and uses the 'LAST' aggregation function to retrieve the last event time.\n* The second subquery uses the SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice' clause to find the first event time for 'Create FI Invoice'. The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and uses the 'FIRST' aggregation function to retrieve the first event time.\n* The two subqueries are then subtracted from each other using the minus sign (-) operator. This calculates the difference between the last event time for 'Clear Invoice' and the first event time for 'Create FI Invoice'.\n* Finally, the AVG aggregation function is applied to the result of the subtraction to calculate the average cycle time. The result is displayed as \"Avg. Cycle Time\".\n\nThe table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query are:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n* Column names: END_TIME, EVENT_NAME\n* Respective values:\n\t+ END_TIME: The last event time for 'Clear Invoice' and the first event time for 'Create FI Invoice'\n\t+ EVENT_NAME: 'Clear Invoice' and 'Create FI Invoice'", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice')) AS \"Avg.
