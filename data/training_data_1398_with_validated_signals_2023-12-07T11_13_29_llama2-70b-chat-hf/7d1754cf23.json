The data is filtered using the 'created_with_dialog' column and ordered by week ascending with nulls first.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its key components.\n\n1. The first line of the query selects the \"DATE_TRUNC\" function to truncate the \"end_time\" column to the first day of the month. This is done to group the data by week.\n2. The second line counts the number of rows in the table where the \"event_name\" column matches the specified pattern.\n3. The third line filters the data to only include rows where the \"created_with_dialog\" column matches the pattern \"created_with_dialog\".\n4. The fourth line orders the data by the first column (which is the week) in ascending order, with nulls first.\n5. The final line fills in missing values in the time series using the \"timeseries\" function.\n\nBased on these components, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the query. It includes references to the table name (\"defaultview-290\"), column names (\"end_time\", \"event_name\", \"created_with_dialog\"), and the respective values used in the query (e.g. \"Change Delivery\", \"Update Delivery\").", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', end_time) AS \"Week\", \n\t\tCOUNT (\"event_name\") \n        FILTER (WHERE BEHAVIOUR \n        \t(EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Change Delivery%' \n         \tOR event_name LIKE 'Update Delivery%') \n        AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)) AS \"# Cases\"\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-290\")\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('Month'), NULL\n\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
