Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* Selection clause: The query selects three columns, \"Vendor Name\", \"Missed Cash Discounts in $\", and \"Invoice Amount in $\".\n\t* From clause: The query is applied to the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n\t* Where clause: The query filters records where the last item due date is less than the last item clearing date.\n\t* Group by clause: The query groups records by the first column, which is assumed to be the vendor name.\n\t* Order by clause: The query sorts the results in descending order by the second column, which is the missed cash discounts.\n2. Breaking down the calculation for each column:\n\t* \"Vendor Name\": The query simply selects the value of the \"Last PO Vendor Name\" column.\n\t* \"Missed Cash Discounts in $\": The query calculates the missed cash discounts by multiplying the converted USD amount by the number of cash discount days and then subtracting the converted USD cash discount amount.\n\t* \"Invoice Amount in $\": The query calculates the invoice amount by summing the converted USD amount.\n3. Creating a human-readable description that references the table name, column names, and respective values:\n\t* The description starts by stating the main objective of the query, which is to retrieve information for each record in the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n\t* The description then lists the three columns selected by the query, along with their respective calculations.\n\t* The description references the table name and column names throughout, to provide context and clarity.\n\t* The description concludes by mentioning the sorting and grouping of the results.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Last PO Vendor Name\" AS \"Vendor Name\",\n  SUM(\n    (\n      (\"Inv.
