SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, \"Month\" and \"Late Delivery Percentage\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function: The \"Month\" column is created by truncating the \"end_time\" column to the first day of the month using the DATE_TRUNC function.\n3. COUNT and FILTER clauses: The \"Late Delivery Percentage\" column is calculated by counting the number of cases where the \"Actual Delivery Date\" is later than the \"Scheduled Finish Date\", and then dividing that number by the total count of cases. The FILTER clause is used to filter out any cases where the delivery date is earlier than the scheduled finish date.\n4. ORDER BY clause: The results are sorted by the \"Month\" column in ascending order, with NULL values appearing first.\n5. FILL clause: The query uses the FILL clause to fill in missing values in the time series data for the \"Month\" column.\n6. NULLS FIRST clause: The NULLS FIRST clause specifies that NULL values should be treated as the lowest value in the column when sorting.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query's purpose and how it is calculated.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST (end_time))) AS \"Month\", COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds') / COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
