The first part of the query uses a subquery to select the count of events where the event name is 'Update Payment Term'. This subquery is filtered using the 'WHERE' clause to only include events with the specified name.\n2. The second part of the query uses another subquery to select the count of all events.\n3. The two subqueries are then used in a mathematical expression to calculate the average percentage of payment term updates. The expression is: (COUNT(event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Update Payment Term')) / COUNT(event_name)) * 100.\n4. The result of the expression is then selected as the output of the query.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-59\", and the column names are \"event_name\" and \"COUNT(event_name)\". The values used in the query are 'Update Payment Term' and 100, which are mentioned in the signal_description.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Update Payment Term'))\n\t) / (SELECT COUNT(event_name))\n   ) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
