SELECT: The query starts by selecting columns from a table.\n2. AVG: The query calculates the average of a expression.\n3. (SELECT LAST(\"end_time\") FILTER (WHERE \"event_name\" IN ('Release PO'))): This part of the query selects the last \"end_time\" value for events where the \"event_name\" is in ('Release PO').\n4. - (SELECT FIRST(\"end_time\") FILTER (WHERE (\"event_name\" IN ('Create PO Item')))): This part of the query selects the first \"end_time\" value for events where the \"event_name\" is in ('Create PO Item').\n5. AS \"Average cycle time\", \"PO Vendor Name\": The query gives an alias to the calculated column, \"Average cycle time\", and also selects the column \"PO Vendor Name\" from the table.\n6. FROM \"defaultview-124\": The query specifies the table to use, which is \"defaultview-124\".\n7. ORDER BY 1 DESC NULLS LAST: The query sorts the results in descending order based on the first column, and specifies that null values should be treated as the last value.\n8.
