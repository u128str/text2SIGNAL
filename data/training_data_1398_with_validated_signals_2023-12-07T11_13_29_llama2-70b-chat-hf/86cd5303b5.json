First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-299\".\n2. Next, we looked at the SELECT clause, which has two subqueries. The first subquery calculates the count of case_id values that have an event_name of 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated'. The second subquery calculates the total count of case_id values.\n3. We then looked at the FILTER clause, which filters the data to only include rows where the event_name is 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated'.\n4. Finally, we looked at the math expression, which calculates the percentage of Personal Data Change WF Initiated events out of all case_id events by dividing the count of Personal Data Change WF Initiated events by the total count of case_id events and multiplying by 100.\n\nBased on this analysis, we constructed the signal_description, which provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.
