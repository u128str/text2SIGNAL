Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-225\"\n\t* The column names: \"case_id\", \"Event Created By User Type\", \"event_name\"\n\t* The filter conditions:\n\t\t+ \"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')\n\t\t+ event_name LIKE '%Create Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Create Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Reverse Invoice%'\n2. Breaking down the query into its main parts:\n\t* The first part: SUM((SELECT COUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (WHERE ((\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service') AND (event_name LIKE '%Create Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Create Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Reverse Invoice%')))))\n\t* The second part: SUM((SELECT COUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (WHERE event_name LIKE '%Create Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Create Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Post Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Invoice%' OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Credit Memo%' OR event_name LIKE '%Reverse Invoice%') AND \"Event Created By User Type\" IS NOT NULL))\n3. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* Identifying the main purpose of the query: Calculate the percentage of invoices and credit memos created by system or service users.\n\t* Breaking down the query into simpler instructions:\n\t\t+ Calculate the count of case IDs for each event type.\n\t\t+ Filter the count by event types that are of interest (invoices and credit memos).\n\t\t+ Sum up the counts for all event types.\n\t\t+ Divide the sum by the total count of case IDs for all event types.\n\t\t+ Multiply the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n4. Assembling the description:\n\t* Using the identified table and column names.\n\t* Including the filter conditions in a natural language format.\n\t* Using simple language to explain the calculations.\n\t* Formatting the description as a set of instructions.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  SUM(\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            (\n              \"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')\n              AND (\n                event_name LIKE '%Create Invoice%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Create Credit Memo%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Post Invoice%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Post Credit Memo%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Invoice%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Credit Memo%'\n                OR event_name LIKE '%Reverse Invoice%'\n              )\n            )\n        )\n    )\n  ) / SUM(\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name LIKE '%Create Invoice%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Create Credit Memo%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Post Invoice%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Post Credit Memo%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Invoice%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Clear Credit Memo%'\n            OR event_name LIKE '%Reverse Invoice%'\n            AND \"Event Created By User Type\" IS NOT NULL\n        )\n    )\n  ) * 100\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
