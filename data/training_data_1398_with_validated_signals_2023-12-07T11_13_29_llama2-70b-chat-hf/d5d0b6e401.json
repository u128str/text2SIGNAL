Reading the SIGNAL query and identifying the main components such as the select clause, from clause, where clause, group by clause, and order by clause.\n2. Breaking down each component into its constituent parts, such as the column names, table names, and filter conditions.\n3. Using natural language processing techniques to generate human-readable descriptions for each component, taking into account the context and relationships between the components.\n4. Combining the descriptions of each component into a single coherent sentence that summarizes the SIGNAL query.\n5.
