{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Change Status to Closed' event and the first 'Change Status to In Review' event for the defaultview-217 table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Change Status to Closed' event and the first 'Change Status to In Review' event for the defaultview-217 table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is a SELECT statement that chooses the columns and tables to include in the query. In this case, the table is \"defaultview-217\".\n* The second part of the query is a nested SELECT statement that calculates the last end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to Closed'. This is done using the LAST() function and a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include events with the specified name.\n* The third part of the query is another nested SELECT statement that calculates the first end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to In Review'. This is done using the FIRST() function and a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include events with the specified name.\n* The fourth part of the query is a subtraction operation that subtracts the first end_time from the last end_time. This gives us the time difference between the two events.\n* The final part of the query is an AVG() function that calculates the average of the time differences.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Change Status to Closed' event and the first 'Change Status to In Review' event for the defaultview-217 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed'))))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review'))))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
