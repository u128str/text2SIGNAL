First, we have a SELECT clause that selects two columns:\n\t* The first column is the sum of a subquery that counts the number of case_id where the Event Created By User Type is either System or Service and the event_name is like '%Payment%'.\n\t* The second column is the sum of a subquery that counts the number of case_id where the event_name is like '%Payment%' and the Event Created By User Type is not null.\n2. Then, we have a FROM clause that specifies the table name as \"defaultview-225\".\n3. Finally, we have a WHERE clause that filters the results to only include rows where the event_name is like '%Payment%'.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows:\n\n\"Calculate the percentage of payment events created by system or service users out of all payment events. First, count the number of payment events created by system or service users (Event Created By User Type IN ('System', 'Service') and event_name LIKE '%Payment%') and divide it by the total number of payment events (event_name LIKE '%Payment%').
