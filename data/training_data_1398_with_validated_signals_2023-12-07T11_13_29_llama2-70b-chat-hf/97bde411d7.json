Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from a temporary table named temp.\n\t* The temporary table is created by selecting case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, and end_time from the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") table.\n\t* The selected columns are then transformed using a CASE statement, which calculates the AVG_ClearingTime as the difference between the end time and the first end time of the 'Create Accounts Receivable' event, partitioned by 'ARUniqueKey' and ordered by end time.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The first part of the query is the SELECT statement, which selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from the temporary table temp.\n\t* The second part of the query is the temporary table creation, which is defined as a subquery.\n\t* The subquery selects case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, and end_time from the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") table.\n\t* The subquery then applies a CASE statement to calculate the AVG_ClearingTime.\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* The table name is \"defaultview-222\".\n\t* The column names are:\n\t\t+ case_id\n\t\t+ ClearingJournalEntry\n\t\t+ event_name\n\t\t+ end_time\n\t\t+ AVG_ClearingTime (calculated column)\n4. Identifying the filter condition:\n\t* The filter condition is event_name LIKE 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n5. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed by describing the main components of the query, including the table and column names, the filter condition, and the calculated column.\n\t* The description is written in a human-readable format, with explicit reference to the table and column names, and the respective values used in the Signal query.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \n--BillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable') OVER (PARTITION BY \"ARUniqueKey\" ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name LIKE 'Clear Accounts Receivable'\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
