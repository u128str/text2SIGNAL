The query selects four columns from the 'defaultview-225' table:\n\n* \"Inv. Company Code Text\"\n* \"Inv Net Payment Terms period vs. Inv. Vendor Master NDD\" (a calculated column)\n* \"No. Invoices\" (a COUNT aggregation)\n* \"$ in Invoice\" (a SUM aggregation)\n\nThe calculated column \"Inv Net Payment Terms period vs. Inv. Vendor Master NDD\" is created using a CASE statement that compares the values of two columns: \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" and \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\". Depending on the comparison, the column returns one of six possible values:\n\n* 'invoice payment terms are better than vendor payment terms'\n* 'invoice payment terms are the same as vendor payment terms'\n* 'invoice payment terms are worse than vendor payment terms'\n* 'Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period IS NULL'\n* 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD IS NULL'\n* 'Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period AND Last Inv.
