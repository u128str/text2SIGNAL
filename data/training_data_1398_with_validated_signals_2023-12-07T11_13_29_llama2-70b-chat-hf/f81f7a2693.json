Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* avg( ): We are calculating the average of a expression.\n\t* \"Scheduled Start Date\" - \"Actual Start Date\" : We are subtracting the \"Actual Start Date\" from the \"Scheduled Start Date\" to get the difference between the two dates.\n3. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t* \"Scheduled Start Date\"\n\t* \"Actual Start Date\"\n\t* \"Planned Order Number\"\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\nWe are calculating the average difference between the scheduled start date and actual start date for all rows in the \"defaultview-183\" table where the \"Planned Order Number\" column is not null.\n\nThe description is written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values.
