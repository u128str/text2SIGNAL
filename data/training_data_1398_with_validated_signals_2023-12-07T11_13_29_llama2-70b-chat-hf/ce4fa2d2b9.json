{"signal_description": "Retrieve the number of cases where the event name matches the specified pattern and calculate the percentage of cases where the event name is 'Pay Invoice' out of the total number of cases.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the number of cases where the event name matches the specified pattern and calculate the percentage of cases where the event name is 'Pay Invoice' out of the total number of cases.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its components and understanding what each part does.\n\n* The first part of the query is \"SELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES (...))\". This part retrieves the number of cases where the event name matches a specific pattern. The pattern is defined using the MATCHES function, which takes a regular expression as an argument. In this case, the regular expression is \"^ 'Create PR Item' ~> 'Create PO Item' ~> 'Receive PO Item' ~> 'Receive Invoice' ~> 'Reconcile Invoice' ~> 'Approve Invoice' ~> 'Pay Invoice' $\". This regular expression matches any event name that starts with \"Create PR Item\" and ends with \"Pay Invoice\", with any number of intermediate steps in between.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Pay Invoice'))\". This part retrieves the number of cases where the event name is exactly \"Pay Invoice\".\n* The third part of the query is \"/ COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Pay Invoice')) * 100\". This part calculates the percentage of cases where the event name is \"Pay Invoice\" out of the total number of cases.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Retrieve the number of cases where the event name matches the specified pattern and calculate the percentage of cases where the event name is 'Pay Invoice' out of the total number of cases.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES (\n\t^ 'Create PR Item'\n    ~> 'Create PO Item'\n    ~> 'Receive PO Item'\n    ~> 'Receive Invoice'\n    ~> 'Reconcile Invoice'\n    ~> 'Approve Invoice'\n    ~> 'Pay Invoice' $\n        )) \n\t/ COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Pay Invoice')) \n    * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
