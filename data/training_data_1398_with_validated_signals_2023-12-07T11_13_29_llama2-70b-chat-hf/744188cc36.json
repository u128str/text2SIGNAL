In this case, we are selecting a single column, `count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\")`.\n* `count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\")`: This is the aggregation function used to calculate the count of distinct values in the `ARUniqueKey` column. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each unique value is counted only once.\n* `FROM`: This clause specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, we are using the `FLATTEN` function to flatten the data from the `defaultview-197` table.\n* `FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")`: This function flattens the data from the `defaultview-197` table into a flat format, which can be queried using SQL-like syntax.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows: \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'ARUniqueKey' values from the 'defaultview-197' table.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column name, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
