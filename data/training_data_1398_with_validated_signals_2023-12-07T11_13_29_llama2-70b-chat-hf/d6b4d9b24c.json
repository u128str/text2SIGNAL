{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count the number of events with names containing 'Change Delivery' or 'Update Delivery' from the 'defaultview-290' table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by:\n\n1.

Breaking down the FILTER clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* event_name LIKE 'Change Delivery%'\n\t* OR\n\t* event_name LIKE 'Update Delivery%'\n3. Constructing the human-readable description:\n\t* Start with a brief statement of the task, using layman's terms: \"Count the number of events with names containing 'Change Delivery' or 'Update Delivery'.\"\n\t* Explicitly mention the table name and column name: \"from the 'defaultview-290' table.\"\n\t* Include the specific values used in the query: \"with names containing 'Change Delivery' or 'Update Delivery'.\"\n4. JSON formatting:\n\t* Wrap the signal_description in curly braces, { }, to create a JSON object.\n\t* Use double quotes, \" \", to enclose the signal_description text, making it a string value within the JSON object.\n\nThe resulting JSON output is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Count the number of events with names containing 'Change Delivery' or 'Update Delivery' from the 'defaultview-290' table.\"\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
