Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: `count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\" )`\n\t* The FILTER clauses: `WHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and \"AutomationFlag\" is null` and `WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Accounts Receivable')\"`\n\t* The division operator: `/`\n\t* The multiplication operator: `* 100`\n2. Breaking down the FILTER clauses:\n\t* The first FILTER clause filters the data to only include rows where the `event_name` is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and the `AutomationFlag` is null.\n\t* The second FILTER clause filters the data to only include rows where the `event_name` is in the list ('Clear Accounts Receivable').\n3. Understanding the purpose of the query:\nThe query aims to calculate the percentage of accounts receivable that have been cleared with no automation flag, out of all accounts receivable that have been cleared.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\nThe signal_description should provide a clear and concise explanation of the query's purpose. It should mention the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. The description should be written in a human-readable format, as if a human was explaining the query to someone else.\n\nThe signal_description constructed above summarizes the query's purpose and mentions the relevant table name (\"defaultview-222\"), column names (\"ARUniqueKey\", \"event_name\", and \"AutomationFlag\"), and respective values (null and 'Clear Accounts Receivable').", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER\n(WHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and \"AutomationFlag\" is null)\n/ \ncount(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER \n(WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Accounts Receivable'))\n) * 100\n FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
