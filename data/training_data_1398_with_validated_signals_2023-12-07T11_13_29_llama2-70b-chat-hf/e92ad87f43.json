The FILTER clause is used to filter the results to only include rows where the EVENT_NAME column contains the string 'Update PO Payment Terms'. The MATCHES function is used to perform a case-insensitive search for the string.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identify the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-225\"\n* The column names: EVENT_NAME, CASE_ID\n* The filter condition: EVENT_NAME MATCHES (ILIKE 'Update PO Payment Terms')\n\nWe then construct a natural language description of the query by combining these components. We use the phrase \"Retrieve the count of distinct\" to indicate that we are retrieving a count of unique values, and we specify the column name \"case_id\" to indicate which column we are counting. We then explain the filter condition, using the phrase \"where the 'EVENT_NAME' column contains the string\" followed by the specified string.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what data it will return.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES (ILIKE 'Update PO Payment Terms'))\nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
