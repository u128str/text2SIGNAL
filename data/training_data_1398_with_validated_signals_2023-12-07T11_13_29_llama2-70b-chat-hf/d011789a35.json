Item Cash Discount Days 1\": This column contains the number of days within which a payment must be made to take advantage of a cash discount on an invoice item.\n* \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Days\": This column contains the number of days within which a payment must be made after the cash discount period has expired on an invoice item.\n* \"Last Inv. Item Terms of Payment Key\": This column contains information about the payment terms of an invoice item.\n* \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\": This column contains information about the payment terms period of an invoice item.\n\nThe query is using the following filters:\n\n* \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" < \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\": This filter selects only the rows where the cash discount period on the invoice item is shorter than the cash discount period on the purchase order.\n* \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL OR \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0: This filter selects only the rows where the cash discount period on the invoice item is null or zero.\n\nThe query is using the following aggregation functions:\n\n* COUNT(case_id): This function counts the number of rows that match the filter conditions.\n* FILTER(WHERE ...): This function filters the results based on the specified conditions.\n\nThe query is sorted in descending order by the first column using the ORDER BY clause.\n\nOverall, the query is designed to retrieve information about payment terms and cash discounts on purchase orders and invoice items, and to identify any differences between the payment terms on the two types of records.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \ncount(case_id)\n--,\"PO Terms of Payment Key\"\n,\"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\"\n\n--,\"PO Net Payment Days\"\n--, \"Last PO Net Payment Days\"\n--,\"PO Vendor Master Net Payment Days\"\n\n--,\"Last FI Invoice Item Terms of Payment Key\"\n,\"Last Inv.
