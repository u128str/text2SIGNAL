The query also retrieves data on cash discount days and net payment terms period from both the invoice and vendor master data.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Signal query starts by selecting various columns from the 'defaultview-225' table, including the company code, vendor country, vendor number, vendor name, terms of payment key, and vendor master payment terms. It also selects the case ID, cash discount days 1 and 2, net payment terms period, and vendor master CD 1 and CD 2.\n\nThe query then uses a CASE statement to create a new column called 'Max_Days_Invoice' which contains the maximum number of days for the invoice payment terms. It does this by checking if the net payment terms period is null, and if so, using the cash discount days 2 or cash discount days 1 if they are not null.\n\nAnother CASE statement is used to create a new column called 'Max_Days_MD' which contains the maximum number of days for the vendor master payment terms. It does this by checking if the vendor master NDD is null, and if so, using the vendor master CD 2 or vendor master CD 1 if they are not null.\n\nThe query then filters out records where the payment terms on the invoice do not match the payment terms on the vendor master data. It does this by checking if the terms of payment key on the invoice is different from the terms of payment key on the vendor master data.\n\nThe query then calculates the number of invoices with shorter payment terms than the vendor master data using a COUNT function.\n\nFinally, the query orders the results by the 'Max_Days_Invoice' column in descending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the main points of the query, including the tables and columns used, the filters applied, and the calculations performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\t\"Inv.
