The query selects the average of the time difference between two events, 'Create FI Invoice' and 'Create PO Item', for each process instance in the 'defaultview-124' table.\n\nThe query first uses a subquery to retrieve the last 'Create FI Invoice' event time for each process instance, using the 'LAST' aggregation function and 'FILTER' clause to filter for events with the specified name. The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and the result is assigned to a variable.\n\nThe query then uses another subquery to retrieve the first 'Create PO Item' event time for each process instance, using the 'FIRST' aggregation function and 'FILTER' clause to filter for events with the specified name. The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and the result is assigned to a variable.\n\nFinally, the query calculates the time difference between the two events for each process instance by subtracting the first event time from the last event time. The 'AVG' aggregation function is used to calculate the average time difference across all process instances.\n\nThe query uses the 'FROM' clause to specify the table name, 'defaultview-124', and the 'WHERE' clause to filter for process instances that have both 'Create PO Item' and 'Create FI Invoice' events.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation performed and referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create FI Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))      \nFROM \"defaultview-124\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Create FI Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
