Identifying the column names and their respective values used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"Inv. Converted USD Amount\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\"\n\t* \"Last Inv.

Converted USD Amount\" column.\n\t* The selection is filtered by three conditions:\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1\"\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\"\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\"\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* It also includes the query logic, including the filtered conditions.\n\t* The description is written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, columns schema, and respective values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT SUM(\"Inv.
