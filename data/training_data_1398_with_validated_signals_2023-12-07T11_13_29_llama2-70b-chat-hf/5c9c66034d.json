{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-545' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using a combination of SQL-like syntax and specific Signavio Process Intelligence Suite concepts.\n\n* The query starts with the SELECT clause, which defines the columns to be returned. In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The next part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be used. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n* The WHERE clause is used to filter the data to only include process instances where the event name is either \"Create PO Item\" or \"Create PR Item\". This is done using the IN operator.\n* The GROUP BY clause is not explicitly used in the query, which means that the data will be aggregated at the process instance level.\n* The AVG function is used to calculate the average value of the time difference between the two events.\n* The time difference is calculated by subtracting the first END_TIME value for the \"Create PR Item\" event from the last END_TIME value for the \"Create PO Item\" event.\n* The query uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first END_TIME values for the respective event names.\n\nBased on the above explanation, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-545' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PR Item'))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
