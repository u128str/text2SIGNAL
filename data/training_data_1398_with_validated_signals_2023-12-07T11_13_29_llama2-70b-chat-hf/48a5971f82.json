SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Month\" and \"# Cases\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"Month\", is created using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the first occurrence of end_time (per group) to the first day of the month. The truncated date is then used as the column value for \"Month\".\n3. AVG function:\nThe second column, \"# Cases\", is created using the AVG function, which calculates the average of the difference between the first occurrence of end_time for cases where the status was changed to 'Ready For Review' and the first occurrence of end_time for cases where the status was changed to 'In Progress'.\n4. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the \"defaultview-217\" table.\n5. WHERE clause:\nThe query filters the data to only include cases where the status was changed from 'In Progress' to 'Ready For Review', based on the event_name column.\n6. GROUP BY clause:\nThe query groups the data by the first occurrence of end_time for each case.\n7. ORDER BY clause:\nThe query sorts the data by the first occurrence of end_time for each case.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress')) AS \"Month\",\nAVG( \n\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE (event_name = 'Change Status to Ready For Review'))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress')\n    ) AS \"# Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Progress' ~> 'Change Status to Ready For Review')\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
