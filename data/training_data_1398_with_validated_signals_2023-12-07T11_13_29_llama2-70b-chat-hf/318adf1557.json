In this case, there are no conditions specified, so all rows in the table will be retrieved.\n* The fourth part of the query uses a COUNT function to count the number of rows in the table that match the specified conditions. In this case, the COUNT function is applied to the \"case_id\" column.\n* The final part of the query specifies the columns that will be included in the output, which are the same as the columns selected in the first part of the query.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.
