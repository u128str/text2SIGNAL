The count(case_id) column is aliased as \"# Projects\", which suggests that it represents the number of projects.\n3. The WBSE_ProjectType column is aliased as \"Project Type\", which suggests that it represents the type of project.\n4. The FROM clause specifies the table name as \"defaultview-197\".\n5.
