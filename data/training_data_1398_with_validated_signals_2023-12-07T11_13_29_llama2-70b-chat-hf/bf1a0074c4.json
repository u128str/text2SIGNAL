The subquery uses the `last` and `first` aggregate functions to get the last and first `end_time` values that match certain conditions. The conditions are defined using the `Filter` function, which filters the data based on the `event_name` column. The subquery is then wrapped in a `SELECT` statement that uses the `avg` aggregate function to calculate the average time difference.\n\nThe query also includes a `FROM` clause that specifies the table to use for the query, which is `\"defaultview-183\"`. Additionally, there is a `WHERE` clause that filters the data to only include rows where the `\"Planned Order Number\"` column is not null.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Get the last `end_time` value for each planned order that has an event name of 'Delivered' or 'Technically Completed'.\n2. Get the first `end_time` value for each planned order that has an event name of 'Create Process Order'.\n3. Calculate the time difference between the last and first `end_time` values for each planned order.\n4. Calculate the average time difference across all planned orders.\n\nThe resulting signal description provides a clear and concise summary of the query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NOT NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
