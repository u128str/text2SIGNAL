It selects the sum of a column named \"SLA Definition Count\" from a table named \"defaultview-370\".\n\nTo create the human-readable description, we can start by mentioning the table name, which is \"defaultview-370\". Then, we can specify the column name, which is \"SLA Definition Count\", and the fact that we want to retrieve its sum.\n\nThe resulting description is: \"Retrieve the sum of 'SLA Definition Count' column from the 'defaultview-370' table.\"\n\nThis description provides a clear and concise explanation of what the SIGNAL query is doing, making it easier for users to understand the purpose of the query without having to read the actual query code.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nsum(\"SLA Definition Count\")\nFROM \"defaultview-370\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
