First, we select the last end time of all events where the name is like 'Clear%'. This is done using the LAST function with a filter clause that selects only events with names that start with 'Clear'. The result of this step is a set of timestamps, which are the last end times of all clearing events.\n2. Next, we filter out the last end time of the event with the name 'Create Accounts Receivable'. This is done using the LAST function with a filter clause that selects only events with the name 'Create Accounts Receivable'. The result of this step is a single timestamp, which is the last end time of the event with the name 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n3. We then subtract the last end time of the event with the name 'Create Accounts Receivable' from the last end time of each clearing event. This is done using the minus (-) operator. The result of this step is a set of timestamps, which represent the clearing time for each clearing event.\n4. Finally, we calculate the average of the clearing times by using the AVG function. The result of this step is a single value, which is the average clearing time for all clearing events.\n5. The result is then selected and returned as 'AVG Clearing Time'.\n\nThe table name used in the SIGNAL query is \"defaultview-222\". The column names used are \"end_time\" and \"event_name\".
