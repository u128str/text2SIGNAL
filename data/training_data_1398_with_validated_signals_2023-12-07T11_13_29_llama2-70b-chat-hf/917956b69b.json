The query selects the minimum value of a calculated column called AVG_ClearingTime.\n2. The AVG_ClearingTime column is calculated by taking the difference between the end time of the 'Create Billing Document' event and the first end time of the 'Clear Accounts Receivable' event, partitioned by billing document, ordered by end time.\n3. The query filters the data to only include rows where the event name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n4. The data is flattened using the FLATTEN function, and the resulting table is aliased as \"defaultview-197\".\n5. The query selects the case ID, ClearingJournalEntry, BillingDocument, event name, and the calculated AVG_ClearingTime column from the flattened table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable description of the query, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT MIN(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \nBillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Billing Document') OVER (PARTITION BY BillingDocument ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
