Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (BOOL_OR (ChangeType = 'Update'))), \"InvoiceCompanyCode\", \"SalesDocItemPlant\"\n\t* The FROM clause: \"defaultview-383\"\n\t* The ORDER BY clause: 1 DESC\n\t* The LIMIT clause: 10\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID): This calculates the number of unique case IDs in the table.\n\t* FILTER (WHERE (BOOL_OR (ChangeType = 'Update'))): This filters the rows where the change type is 'Update'.\n\t* / COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID) * 100: This calculates the change rate by dividing the number of updated case IDs by the total number of case IDs and multiplying by 100.\n3. Identifying the columns used in the query:\n\t* CASE_ID\n\t* ChangeType\n\t* InvoiceCompanyCode\n\t* SalesDocItemPlant\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values:\n\t* \"Retrieve the change rate, invoice company code, and sales doc item plant for the top 10 rows in the 'defaultview-383' table.\"\n\t* \"The change rate is calculated by counting the number of distinct case IDs that have an update change type and dividing that by the total number of distinct case IDs, then multiplying by 100.\"\n\t* \"The result is sorted in descending order based on the change rate.\"\n5.
