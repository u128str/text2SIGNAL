Breaking down the FILTER clause into its components:\n\t* WHERE: Filter the results to only include events that meet the specified condition.\n\t* EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Clear%': The condition is that the \"EVENT_NAME\" column must start with 'Clear'. The '%' wildcard character is used to match any characters after 'Clear'.\n4.
