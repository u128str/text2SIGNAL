Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT(CASE_ID)\n\t* FILTER clauses: Two filters are applied, one for null Last Invoice Payment Date and another for Last Invoice Due Date greater than or equal to Last Invoice Payment Date.\n\t* Calculation: The result of the two filters is divided by the total number of cases (COUNT(CASE_ID)) and then multiplied by 100.\n2. Breaking down the query into more detailed parts:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n\t* Column names:\n\t\t+ CASE_ID\n\t\t+ Last Invoice Due Date\n\t\t+ Last Invoice Payment Date\n3. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* Identifying the purpose of the query: Calculate the percentage of overdue invoices.\n\t* Explaining the conditions for the filters: Last Invoice Payment Date is not null, and Last Invoice Due Date is greater than or equal to Last Invoice Payment Date.\n\t* Mentioning the table name and column names: \"defaultview-545\" and CASE_ID, Last Invoice Due Date, and Last Invoice Payment Date.\n4.
