Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-217\"\n2. Understanding the query's syntax: SELECT AVG(expression) FROM table_name\n3. Breaking down the expression: \n\t* First, we identify the subqueries: \n\t\t+ SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Unflag Issue'\n\t\t+ SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Flag Issue'\n\t* Then, we extract the column names and respective values: \n\t\t+ end_time\n\t\t+ event_name\n\t\t+ 'Unflag Issue'\n\t\t+ 'Flag Issue'\n4. Building the human-readable description:\n\t* We start with the table name, followed by a brief description of the query's purpose.\n\t* We then mention the column names and respective values used in the query, using natural language to explain their role in the calculation.\n\t* Finally, we concisely summarize the query's objective.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name = 'Unflag Issue')\n      - (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n         WHERE event_name = 'Flag Issue')\n        )\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
