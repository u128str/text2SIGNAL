Cycle Time\", \"Avg. Inv. Payment Time\", and \"PO Type\".\n* The second part of the query uses a subquery to calculate the values for these columns.\n* The subquery selects four columns: \"Last(END_TIME)\", \"First(END_TIME)\", \"Last(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\", and \"First(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Record Invoice Receipt', 'Create FI Invoice')\".\n* The subquery calculates the average cycle time as the difference between the last end time and the first end time.\n* The subquery calculates the average inventory payment time as the difference between the last end time for events named 'Clear Invoice' and the first end time for events named 'Record Invoice Receipt' or 'Create FI Invoice'.\n* The subquery sums up the last FI invoice item gross amount local currency for PO Type.\n* The final part of the query orders the results by the third column, \"PO Type\", in descending order.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"Avg.
