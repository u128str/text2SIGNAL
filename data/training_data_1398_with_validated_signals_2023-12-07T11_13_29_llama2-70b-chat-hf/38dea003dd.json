SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Month when Review completed\" and \"Duration\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column \"Month when Review completed\" is created using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the date to the first day of the month. The function takes two arguments: the first is the column to truncate, which is \"end_time\", and the second is the truncation unit, which is \"month\".\n3. Subqueries:\nThe second column \"Duration\" is calculated using an average of the differences between two subqueries. The first subquery selects the last \"end_time\" where the \"event_name\" is \"Change Status to Closed\". The second subquery selects the last \"end_time\" where the \"event_name\" is \"Change Status to In Review\".\n4. WHERE clause:\nThe query filters the rows to only those where the \"event_name\" matches either \"Change Status to In Review\" or \"Change Status to To Do\".\n5. GROUP BY clause:\nThe query groups the rows by the first column, which is the month.\n6. ORDER BY clause:\nThe query sorts the results by the first column in ascending order.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a concise and clear explanation of the SIGNAL query's purpose and how it processes the data.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed', 'Change Status to To Do'))) AS \"Month when Review completed\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed'\n        )\n      \t- (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n      \t   WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Review')\n       ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review' ~> ('Change Status to To Do' | 'Change Status to Closed'))\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
