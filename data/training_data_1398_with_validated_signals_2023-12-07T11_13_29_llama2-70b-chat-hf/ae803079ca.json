The first part of the query is the SELECT clause, which specifies the columns that should be included in the output. In this case, we have two columns: \"Cases\" and \"Changed Table\".\n2. The next part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table or tables to query. In this case, we are querying a flattened version of the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n3. The WHERE clause is used to filter the results, and in this case, we are only including rows where the \"Changed Table\" column is not null.\n4. The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the results in descending order by the \"Cases\" column.\n5. The LIMIT clause is used to limit the number of rows returned to 500.\n\nBy analyzing these parts, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that explains what the query is doing and what columns are being used.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"Cases\", \"Changed Table\"\nFROM FLATTEN((SELECT \"case_id\", \"event_name\", \"end_time\", \"Change New Value\", \"Change Old Value\", \"Change Type\", \"Changed Field\", \"Changed Object Id\", \"Changed Table\", \"Event Created By User Id\", \"Event Created By User Type\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\") AS sub)\nWHERE \"Changed Table\" IS NOT NULL\norder by 1 desc\nLIMIT 500 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
