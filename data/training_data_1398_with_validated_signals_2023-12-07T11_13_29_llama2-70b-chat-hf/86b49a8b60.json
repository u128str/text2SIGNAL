Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: `SELECT avg(`\n\t* The subquery 1: `Select last(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))`\n\t* The subquery 2: `Select first(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))`\n\t* The FROM clause: `FROM \"defaultview-183\"`\n\t* The WHERE clause: `WHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL`\n2. Breaking down each subquery:\n\t* Subquery 1: `Select last(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))`\n\t\t+ `last(end_time)`: Returns the last value of the `end_time` column.\n\t\t+ `Filter(Where event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))`: Filters the rows where the `event_name` column is either 'Delivered' or 'Technically Completed'.\n\t* Subquery 2: `Select first(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))`\n\t\t+ `first(end_time)`: Returns the first value of the `end_time` column.\n\t\t+ `Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))`: Filters the rows where the `event_name` column is 'Create Process Order'.\n3. Understanding the purpose of the query:\nThe query aims to calculate the average time difference between the last 'Delivered' or 'Technically Completed' event and the first 'Create Process Order' event, for all processes where the 'Planned Order Number' is null.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\nThe signal_description should provide a clear and concise explanation of the query's purpose. It should mention the main components of the query, such as the table name, column names, and the conditions applied in the subqueries.\n\nThe signal_description constructed above provides a step-by-step explanation of the query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and the logic behind the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
