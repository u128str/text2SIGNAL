{"signal_description": "Count the number of case_id in the 'defaultview-545' table where the event_name is not in ('Close Incident')", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count the number of case_id in the 'defaultview-545' table where the event_name is not in ('Close Incident')\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is selecting the COUNT of the case_id column in the \"defaultview-545\" table. The COUNT is filtered by a subquery that checks if the event_name column has a value of 'Close Incident'. The subquery uses the BOOL_AND function to check if the event_name is not in the specified value.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Select the COUNT of the case_id column in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n2. Filter the COUNT by a subquery that checks if the event_name column has a value of 'Close Incident'.\n3. Use the BOOL_AND function to check if the event_name is not in the specified value.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should be \"Count the number of case_id in the 'defaultview-545' table where the event_name is not in ('Close Incident')\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \n\t(SELECT BOOL_AND(\n NOT event_name IN ('Close Incident')))\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
