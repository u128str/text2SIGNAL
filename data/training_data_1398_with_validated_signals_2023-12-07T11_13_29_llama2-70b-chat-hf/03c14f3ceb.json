Breaking down the SELECT clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* avg(): average function\n\t* Scheduled Start Date - Actual Start Date: expression being averaged\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* defaultview-183: table name\n\t* Scheduled Start Date: column name\n\t* Actual Start Date: column name\n\t* Planned Order Number: column name\n4. Constructing the human-readable description:\n\t* Start by mentioning the table name and column names: \"Calculate the average difference between Scheduled Start Date and Actual Start Date for all rows in the defaultview-183 table\"\n\t* Add the condition from the WHERE clause: \"where Planned Order Number is null\"\n\t* Use natural language to describe the calculation: \"Calculate the average difference between Scheduled Start Date and Actual Start Date\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what it does without having to read the actual query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n\"Scheduled Start Date\" - \"Actual Start Date\" \n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWhere \"Planned Order Number\" is  null \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
