The duration is calculated using the 'end_time' column of the 'defaultview-59' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using a combination of SQL-like syntax and specific Signavio functions. The query can be broken down into several parts:\n\n1. SELECT clause: The SELECT clause selects the columns that will be used in the calculation. In this case, we are only interested in the 'end_time' column.\n2. DURATION function: The DURATION function calculates the time difference between two events. It takes two arguments: the first is a string representing the event name, and the second is a column containing the timestamp of the event. In this case, we are interested in the duration between the last 'Create Invoice' event and the first 'Clear Invoice' event.\n3. AVG function: The AVG function calculates the average of a set of values. In this case, it calculates the average duration between the last 'Create Invoice' event and the first 'Clear Invoice' event.\n4. FROM clause: The FROM clause specifies the table to use for the calculation. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-59\" table.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can say that it calculates the average duration between two specific events in the 'defaultview-59' table, and then divides that duration by 4 hours. The query uses the 'end_time' column to retrieve the timestamps of the events.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(DURATION '4hours')/\nAVG(\n\t(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Create Invoice')\n\t)\n\t-\n(SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Clear Invoice')\n)\n)\n )\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
