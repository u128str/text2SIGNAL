Understanding the purpose of the FILTER clause:\n\t* FILTER (WHERE \"Resolution\" IS NOT NULL): Filter the results to only include rows where the \"Resolution\" column is not null\n4. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-370\"\n\t* Column names: \"Issue Resolution Date\", \"Issue Created Date\", \"Resolution\"\n5.
