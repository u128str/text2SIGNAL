The COUNT is filtered by a subquery that checks if at least one event_name in the table is like '%Update%'.\n\nThe subquery is written in the BOOL_OR function, which returns true if at least one of the conditions inside it is true. In this case, the condition is that the event_name is like '%Update%'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the table name, column name, and the condition used in the filter.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by first mentioning the table name, followed by the column name and the condition used in the filter. In this case, it's \"Count the number of case_id in the 'defaultview-124' table where at least one event_name is like '%Update%'.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name ILIKE '%Update%')))\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
