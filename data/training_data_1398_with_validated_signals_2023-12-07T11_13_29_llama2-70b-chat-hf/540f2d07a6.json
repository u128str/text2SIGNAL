The table name is not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred from the column names that it is likely a table related to purchasing or inventory management.\n* The second part of the query specifies the table to use, which is \"defaultview-225\".\n* The third part of the query uses the GROUP BY clause to group the results by the first column, \"Last PO Company City\".\n* The fourth part of the query uses the ORDER BY clause to order the results in descending order based on the second column, \"No. of Invoices\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as retrieving information about vendor locations and the number of invoices for each location, grouping the results by location and ordering them by the number of invoices in descending order.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \"Last PO Company City\" AS \"Vendor Location/PO city\", COUNT(\"Inv.
