{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Deletion Flag' event and the first 'Create Process Order' event for all processes where the 'Planned Order Number' is null.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Deletion Flag' event and the first 'Create Process Order' event for all processes where the 'Planned Order Number' is null.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: `SELECT avg(`\n\t* The subquery 1: `Select last(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Deletion Flag'))`\n\t* The subquery 2: `Select first(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order'))`\n\t* The FROM clause: `FROM \"defaultview-183\"`\n\t* The WHERE clause: `WHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL`\n2. Breaking down each subquery:\n\t* Subquery 1: `Select last(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Deletion Flag'))`\n\t\t+ `last(end_time)`: Returns the last value of the `end_time` column.\n\t\t+ `Filter(Where event_name IN ('Deletion Flag'))`: Filters the rows where the `event_name` column is in the list ('Deletion Flag').\n\t* Subquery 2: `Select first(end_time) Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order'))`\n\t\t+ `first(end_time)`: Returns the first value of the `end_time` column.\n\t\t+ `Filter(Where event_name IN ('Create Process Order'))`: Filters the rows where the `event_name` column is in the list ('Create Process Order').\n3. Understanding the calculation:\n\t* The SIGNAL query calculates the average time difference between the last 'Deletion Flag' event and the first 'Create Process Order' event.\n\t* The time difference is calculated by subtracting the first 'Create Process Order' event time from the last 'Deletion Flag' event time.\n4. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* The table name is `\"defaultview-183\"`.\n\t* The column names are:\n\t\t+ `end_time`\n\t\t+ `event_name`\n\t\t+ `Planned Order Number`\n5. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.\n\t* It is written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, columns schema, and respective values.\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by combining the information gathered from the SIGNAL query components, subqueries, calculation, and table/column names.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Deletion Flag')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
