The first part of the query is a subquery that selects the count of events with the name 'Change Status to In Progress'. This subquery is wrapped in a parentheses and is used as an argument to the AVG aggregation function.\n2. The second part of the query is a filter clause that filters the results of the first subquery. The filter clause checks if the count of events with the name 'Change Status to In Review' is greater than one. If this condition is met, then the corresponding row is included in the result set.\n3. The third part of the query is a FROM clause that specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, the table is named \"defaultview-217\".\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by breaking down the query into its constituent parts and describing each part in a human-readable format. The description includes the table name, column names, and respective values that are used in the query. The description is written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table schema and the data it contains.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG((\n\tSELECT count(event_name) \n    WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress'\n    )-1)\nFILTER (WHERE (SELECT count(event_name) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review')) >1 )\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
