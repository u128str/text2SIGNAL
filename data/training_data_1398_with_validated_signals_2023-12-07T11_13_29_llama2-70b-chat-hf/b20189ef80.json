Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-57\"\n\t* The column names: \"case_id\", \"Last GR Creation Date\", \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\", \"PO Item Delivery Completed\"\n\t* The filter conditions: DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\" AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n\t* The calculation: COUNT(case_id) / COUNT(case_id) * 100\n2. Breaking down the filter conditions into simpler parts:\n\t* Filter 1: DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\"\n\t* Filter 2: \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n3.
