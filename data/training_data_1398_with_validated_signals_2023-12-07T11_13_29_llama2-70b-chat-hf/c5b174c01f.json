The parentheses around the column name are optional, but they make the query more readable.\n* `FROM \"defaultview-370\"`: This clause specifies the table from which we want to retrieve data. The table name is enclosed in double quotes to indicate that it is a string.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as: \"Retrieve the count of unique 'case_id' values from the 'defaultview-370' table.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column name, and the aggregation function used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\ncount(\"case_id\")\nFROM \"defaultview-370\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
