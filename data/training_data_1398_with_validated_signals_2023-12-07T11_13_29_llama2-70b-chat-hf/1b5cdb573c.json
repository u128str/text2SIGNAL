SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. SUM((SELECT COUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))))): This part of the query calculates the sum of the number of cases where the event name is 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated'. The COUNT(CASE_ID) function counts the number of unique case IDs in the table, and the FILTER clause filters the results to only include cases where the event name matches the specified value.\n3. / COUNT(CASE_ID) * 100: This part of the query calculates the percentage of Personal Data Change WF Initiated events out of all events in the table. The COUNT(CASE_ID) function counts the total number of case IDs in the table, and the result is divided by this number to get the percentage. The * 100 multiplies the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n4. FROM \"defaultview-299\": This part of the query specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-299\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the percentage of Personal Data Change WF Initiated events out of all events in the defaultview-299 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nSUM(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER (\n \tWHERE (EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))))) \n/ COUNT (CASE_ID) \n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-299\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
