In this case, we have two column names: \"AR_InvoicedAmountInGlobalCurrency\" and \"AR_ClearedAmountInGlobalCurrency\".\n3. We then constructed a human-readable description of the query by using the column names and their respective values. We used the phrase \"Calculate the sum of\" to indicate that the query is calculating a sum, and then listed the two column names separated by a space.\n4.
