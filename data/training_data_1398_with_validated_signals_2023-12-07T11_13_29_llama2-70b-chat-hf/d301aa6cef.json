First, we select the last end time of an event named 'Receive Return' using the LAST() function. This is done using the table name \"defaultview-9\" and the column name \"end_time\".\n2. Next, we select the first end time of an event named 'Create Return Request' using the FIRST() function. This is also done using the table name \"defaultview-9\" and the column name \"end_time\".\n3. We then subtract the two times to get the difference between the two events.\n4. Finally, we take the median of the resulting values using the MEDIAN() function.
