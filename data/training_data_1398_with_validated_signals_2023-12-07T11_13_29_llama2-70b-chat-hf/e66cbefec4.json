This will give us the number of unique CASE_IDs for each row in the table.\n\nThe query then uses the CASE_ID column in a CASE expression to create a new column that contains the Division Text. This is done by using the AS keyword to give the new column a name, and then referencing the Division Text column in the SELECT clause.\n\nThe query then groups the results by the new Division Text column using the GROUP BY clause.\n\nFinally, the query sorts the results in descending order by the number of CASE_IDs using the ORDER BY clause.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. It also provides a brief description of what the query does, using natural language.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"# Process Orders\", \"Division Text\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nGROUP BY 2\norder by 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
