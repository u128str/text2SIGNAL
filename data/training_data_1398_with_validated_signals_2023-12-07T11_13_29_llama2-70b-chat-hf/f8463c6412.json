Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-59\".\n2. Identifying the column names used in the query:\n\t* case_id\n\t* event_name\n3. Understanding the filter condition:\n\t* event_name MATCHES('Create Invoice' \t~> 'Post Invoice' \t~> 'Clear Invoice' \t~> 'Due Date passed')\n\tThis condition is filtering the rows where the value in the event_name column matches the given pattern. The pattern is a sequence of events, where each event is separated by the \"~>\" symbol.\n4. Understanding the calculation:\n\t* COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES('Create Invoice' \t~> 'Post Invoice' \t~> 'Clear Invoice' \t~> 'Due Date passed'))\n\tThis is counting the number of case_id where the filter condition is met.\n5. Understanding the division:\n\t* COUNT(case_id) / COUNT(case_id)\n\tThis is dividing the count of case_id where the filter condition is met by the total count of case_id.\n6.
