In this case, the table is named \"defaultview-57\". The COUNT function is used to count the number of rows in the table that match the specified filter conditions.\n\nThe filter conditions are specified using the FILTER clause, which is used to filter the rows based on a given condition. In this case, the condition is that the event_name column should not match 'Create Goods Receipt' and should match either 'Record Invoice Receipt' or 'Create FI Invoice'. The NOT keyword is used to negate the first condition, and the | (pipe) character is used to specify a logical OR between the two match conditions.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should clearly state the table name, column names, and the filter conditions used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE NOT (event_name MATCHES('Create Goods Receipt'))\n\tAND (event_name MATCHES(('Record Invoice Receipt'|'Create FI Invoice')))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
