In this case, we are selecting two columns:\n\t+ The first column is the average of the END_TIME column, but only for rows where the EVENT_NAME is 'Complete Supply Planning' and the Step Status is 'COMPLETED'. This is specified using a subquery with a FILTER clause.\n\t+ The second column is the average of the END_TIME column, but only for rows where the EVENT_NAME is 'Start Supply Planning' and the Step Status is 'COMPLETED'. This is also specified using a subquery with a FILTER clause.\n* Next, we have a mathematical operation that subtracts the second column from the first column.\n* Finally, we multiply the result by 14.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query in a way that is easy to understand, without getting bogged down in the details of the SIGNAL syntax. It clearly explains what the query is trying to achieve, which can be helpful for users who are trying to understand the purpose of the query or who want to modify it to suit their needs.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(\nAVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Complete Supply Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\n-\nAVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Start Supply Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\n) * 14\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
