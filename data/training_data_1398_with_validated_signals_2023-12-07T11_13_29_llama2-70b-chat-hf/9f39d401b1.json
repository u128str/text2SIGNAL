The DISTINCT keyword indicates that we want to count the number of unique values in this column.\n3. /: The forward slash is used as a divide operator.\n4. COUNT(case_id): The second part of the SELECT clause is another COUNT function, this time applied to the column case_id.\n5. FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\"): The query specifies that the data should be retrieved from the FLATTEN table named \"defaultview-197\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is presented in the expected output format of JSON.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ReferenceTimesheetRecord) \n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
