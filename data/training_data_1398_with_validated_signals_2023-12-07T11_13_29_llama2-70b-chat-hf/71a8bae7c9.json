The cycle time is calculated as the average of the differences between the last and first event times for 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' events that occurred within 3 days.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its components and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n1. The first part of the query selects the average cycle time for creating a purchase order (PO) and releasing it:\n\nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME)) - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME))) AS \"Avg. Cycle Time\"\n\nThis part of the query calculates the average time it takes to create a PO and release it. The LAST(END_TIME) and FIRST(END_TIME) functions are used to get the last and first event times for the 'Create PO Item' and 'Release PO' events, respectively. The difference between these times is calculated, and the result is divided by 100 to get the average cycle time.\n\n2. The second part of the query selects the average cycle time for creating a PO and releasing it, but only for events that occurred within 3 days:\n\nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item')) AS \"Avg. Cycle Time PO Creation to PO Release\"\n\nThis part of the query is similar to the first part, but it only considers events that occurred within 3 days. The LAST(END_TIME) and FIRST(END_TIME) functions are used to get the last and first event times for the 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' events, respectively, that occurred within 3 days. The difference between these times is calculated, and the result is divided by 100 to get the average cycle time.\n\n3. The final part of the query multiplies the average cycle time by 100:\n\nSELECT\n(\"Avg. Cycle Time PO Creation to PO Release\"/\"Avg. Cycle Time\") * 100\n\nThis part of the query takes the average cycle time for creating a PO and releasing it (from the second part of the query) and multiplies it by 100. The result is the final average cycle time for creating a PO and releasing it, expressed as a percentage.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the SIGNAL query by describing each part of the query in a human-readable format and referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(\"Avg.
