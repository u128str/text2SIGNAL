First, filter the unique event IDs where the change type is 'Update'. Then, count the number of distinct unique event IDs and average the result.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed by first selecting the average of a subquery that filters the unique event IDs where the change type is 'Update'. The subquery uses the COUNT function to count the number of distinct unique event IDs. The outer query selects the average of this subquery.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the unique event IDs where the change type is 'Update'. This is done using the FILTER function in the subquery.\n2. Count the number of distinct unique event IDs using the COUNT function.\n3. Average the result using the AVG function in the outer query.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should mention the table name (\"defaultview-383\"), the column names (\"UniqueEventId\" and \"ChangeType\"), and the respective values (the filter condition ChangeType = 'Update' and the aggregation function COUNT(DISTINCT)). The description should also mention the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average number of changes per case.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Average number of changes per case\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
