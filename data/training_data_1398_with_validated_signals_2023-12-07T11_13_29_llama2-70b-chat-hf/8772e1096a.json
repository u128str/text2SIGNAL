This tells us that the query is also selecting a column named \"Event Created By User Type\".\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM FLATTEN('defaultview-124')\". This tells us that the query is operating on a flattened table named \"defaultview-124\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should mention the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. In this case, the signal_description should mention \"defaultview-124\" as the table name, \"case_id\" and \"Event Created By User Type\" as the column names, and the fact that the query is selecting a count of \"case_id\" and the values of \"Event Created By User Type\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id), \"Event Created By User Type\"\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
