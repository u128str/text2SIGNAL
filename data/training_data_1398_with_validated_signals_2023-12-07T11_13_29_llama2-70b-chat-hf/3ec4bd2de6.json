Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: Count(distinct TimesheetRecord)\n\t* FILTER clauses:\n\t\t+ WHERE event_name = 'Create Timesheet Record'\n\t\t+ WHERE event_name IN ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', 'Cancel Timesheet Record')\n\t* FROM clause: FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n2.
