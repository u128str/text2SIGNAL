The subquery uses the 'FIRST' function to select the first 'END_TIME' value for each event, and the 'IN' operator to filter for events with the names 'Flag Issue' and 'Unflag Issue'.\n\nThe main query then selects the 'IssueType' column and groups the result by it using the 'GROUP BY' clause.\n\nFinally, the query projects the calculated average time difference as a column named 'Time'.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG ((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Unflag Issue')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Flag Issue'))), \"IssueType\"\nas \"Time\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Flag Issue' ~> 'Unflag Issue')\nGROUP BY 2 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
