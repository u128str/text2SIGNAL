In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The first part of the query uses a subquery to retrieve the last event time for events with names 'Delivered' or 'Technically Completed'. The subquery uses the FILTER clause to filter the events based on their names, and the LAST function to retrieve the last event time for each filtered event.\n* The second part of the query uses another subquery to retrieve the first event time for events with the name 'Create Process Order'. Similarly, the subquery uses the FILTER clause to filter the events based on their names, and the FIRST function to retrieve the first event time for each filtered event.\n* The main query then calculates the time difference between the two subqueries using the minus (-) operator.\n* Finally, the query uses the FROM clause to specify the table to query, which in this case is \"defaultview-183\".\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the last event time for events with names 'Delivered' or 'Technically Completed'.\n2. Retrieve the first event time for events with the name 'Create Process Order'.\n3. Calculate the time difference between the two event times.\n4. Return the average of the time differences for the default view 'defaultview-183'.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and human-readable description of the query, highlighting the main components of the query, such as the table name, column names, and respective values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Delivered', 'Technically Completed')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
