The first part of the query is \"SELECT AVG\", which is a standard SQL statement used to calculate the average of a column.\n2. The next part is \"((SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name))\", which is a nested query that calculates the difference between the total count of the 'event_name' column and the count of distinct values in the 'event_name' column.\n3. The nested query is enclosed in parentheses and uses two COUNT functions with different arguments. The first COUNT function counts the total number of rows in the table where the 'event_name' column is not null, while the second COUNT function counts the number of distinct values in the 'event_name' column.\n4. The minus sign (-) operator is used to subtract the count of distinct values from the total count, resulting in a difference value.\n5. The final part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-545'\", which specifies the table to use for the query.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-545\", and the column names are \"event_name\". The values used in the query are the total count of event_name and the count of distinct event_name values. The description is constructed using natural language instructions that reference the table and column names, providing a human-readable explanation of the query's purpose.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG((SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name)))\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
