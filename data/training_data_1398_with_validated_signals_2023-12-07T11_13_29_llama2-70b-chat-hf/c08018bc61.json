This part retrieves the creation date of purchase orders. The date is truncated to the first day of the month using the DATE_TRUNC function. The first end time of events with the name 'Create PO Item' is selected using the FIRST function, and the WHERE clause filters the events to only those with the name 'Create PO Item'.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE ('Last Invoice Due Date' < 'Last Invoice Payment Date')) / COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE ('Last Invoice Payment Date' IS NOT NULL)) * 100 AS 'Late Payment Rate'\". This part calculates the late payment rate for each month. The COUNT function counts the number of cases where the last invoice due date is before the last invoice payment date, and the result is divided by the total number of cases with a non-null last invoice payment date. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n* The final part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-545' ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL\". This part retrieves the data from the 'defaultview-545' table, orders the results by the first column in ascending order, and fills in missing values in the time series using the FILL TIMESERIES function. The NULLS FIRST clause specifies that null values should be treated as the first value in the series.\n\nBy combining these parts, the SIGNAL query retrieves the creation date of purchase orders and the percentage of late payments for each month.
