Identifying the table name, column names, and respective values used in the SIGNAL query.\n2. Understanding the query's logic and intent, including the filtering, grouping, and sorting criteria.\n3. Crafting a human-readable description that explains the query's purpose and the data it retrieves, using clear and concise language.\n4. Formatting the description into a JSON object, with the key being \"signal_description\" and the value being the text of the description.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* SELECT clause:\n\t+ \"Last PO Purchasing Organization\" AS \"Purchasing Organization\" - retrieves the last purchasing organization name from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n\t+ SUM (\"Inv. Converted USD Amount\") AS \"Invoice Amount in $\" - calculates the sum of the invoice amount in USD for each group.\n\t+ COUNT(case_id) AS \"No. of Invoices\" - counts the number of invoices for each group.\n* FROM clause:\n\t+ \"defaultview-225\" - specifies the table to query.\n* WHERE clause:\n\t+ (\"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" IS NULL) - filters for records where the last item clearing date is null.\n\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()) - filters for records where the last item due date is before the current day.\n* GROUP BY clause:\n\t+ 1 - groups the data by the first column (purchasing organization name).\n* ORDER BY clause:\n\t+ 2 DESC - sorts the data in descending order based on the invoice amount.\n* LIMIT clause:\n\t+ 10 - limits the result to the top 10 purchasing organizations.\n\nBy analyzing the query's structure and logic, we can understand that it aims to retrieve the top 10 purchasing organizations with the highest invoice amount in USD, while filtering out records with a null last item clearing date and a last item due date before the current day. The result should include the purchasing organization name, the sum of the invoice amount in USD, and the number of invoices.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\"Last PO Purchasing Organization\" AS \"Purchasing Organization\"\n,SUM (\"Inv.
