Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Item Delivery Date\") - \"PO Requested Delivery Date\"\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* \"Last GR Item Delivery Date\" and \"PO Requested Delivery Date\" are columns in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n4. Understanding the purpose of the FILTER clause:\n\t* The FILTER clause filters the rows from the \"defaultview-545\" table where the last GR creation date is after the PO requested delivery date and the PO delivery status is 'Received'.\n5. Combining the information from steps 2-4 to create a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"Calculate the average difference between the last GR item delivery date and the PO requested delivery date, filtered by the PO delivery status being 'Received' and the last GR creation date being after the PO requested delivery date.\"\n\nThe signal_description is a JSON object with a single key, \"signal_description\", whose value is a string that summarizes the SIGNAL query.
