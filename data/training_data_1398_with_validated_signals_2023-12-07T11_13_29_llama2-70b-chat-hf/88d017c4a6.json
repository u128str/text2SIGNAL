In this case, we are interested in the sum of the \"PO Amount Discount\" column.\n* SUM() function: This function calculates the sum of the values in the specified column.\n* \"PO Amount Discount\" column: This is the column from which we want to calculate the sum.\n* FROM clause: This clause specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-431\" table.\n* WHERE clause: This clause specifies the condition that must be met for a row to be included in the output. In this case, we are only interested in rows where the \"PO Item Line Type\" column is equal to 'Catalog'.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we need to break down the query into its component parts and then describe each part in a way that is easy to understand. We start by describing the purpose of the query (retrieve the sum of the 'PO Amount Discount' column), then describe the table and column(s) involved, and finally describe the condition that must be met for a row to be included in the output.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT -SUM(\"PO Amount Discount\") AS \"Total PO discount Amount\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\"\nWHERE \"PO Item Line Type\" = 'Catalog' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
