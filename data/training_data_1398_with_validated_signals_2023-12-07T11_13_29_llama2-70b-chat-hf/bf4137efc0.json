Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-59\".\n2. Identifying the column names used in the query:\n\t* \"case_id\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\"\n3. Understanding the logic of the query:\n\t+ The first part of the query calculates the count of case_id where the last inventory item clearing date is null and the last inventory item due date is before the current day.\n\t+ The second part of the query calculates the count of case_id where the last inventory item clearing date is null.\n\t+ The final part of the query calculates the percentage of the first part out of the second part.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t+ We start by describing the table name and the column names involved in the query.\n\t+ We then explain the logic of the query in a human-readable format, using phrases such as \"calculate the percentage of cases\" and \"out of all cases\".\n\t+ We end by providing the final calculation, which is the percentage of cases where the last inventory item clearing date is null and the last inventory item due date is before the current day, out of all cases where the last inventory item clearing date is null.\n\nNote: The signal_description is not a direct copy-paste of the SIGNAL query, but rather a human-readable summary of the query's logic and calculations.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT (case_id) FILTER (\n        WHERE (\"Last Inv.
