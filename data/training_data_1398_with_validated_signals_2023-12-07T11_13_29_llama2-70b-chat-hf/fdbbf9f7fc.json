{"signal_description": "Retrieve the percentage of delivery-related events created by System, Service, or Batch Job, out of all delivery-related events, from the defaultview-290 table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the percentage of delivery-related events created by System, Service, or Batch Job, out of all delivery-related events, from the defaultview-290 table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the given SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n1. The first part of the query is SELECT, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. The next part is COUNT(\"event_name\"), which tells us that we are counting the number of rows in the table where the \"event_name\" column has a specific value.\n3. The FILTER clause is used to filter the data before counting, and it specifies that we only want to count rows where the \"Behavior\" column has a value of 'System', 'Service', or 'Batch Job'.\n4. The MATCHES clause is used to match the filtered data against a pattern, which in this case is \"created_with_dialog\".\n5. The last part of the query is FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-290\"), which tells us that the data is being retrieved from a table named \"defaultview-290\".\n6. The WHERE clause is used to filter the data further, and it specifies that we only want to retrieve rows where the \"event_name\" column contains the string 'Change Delivery' or 'Update Delivery'.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is: \"Retrieve the percentage of delivery-related events created by System, Service, or Batch Job, out of all delivery-related events, from the defaultview-290 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    COUNT(\"event_name\") FILTER (\n        WHERE BEHAVIOR (\n              \"EventCreatedByUserType\"  IN ('System','Service','Batch Job')\n            ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)\n    ) / COUNT(\"event_name\") * 100\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-290\")\nWHERE (event_name LIKE 'Change Delivery%' \n\tOR event_name LIKE 'Update Delivery%') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
