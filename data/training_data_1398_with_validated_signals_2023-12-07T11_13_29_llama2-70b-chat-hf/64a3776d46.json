The FILTER() function is used to filter the rows where the event_name does not match the pattern 'Create Billing Document' and is not followed by 'Create Invoice'.\n\nThe MATCHES() function is used to perform a regular expression match on the event_name column. The pattern 'Create Billing Document' is negated using the NOT operator, and the ~> operator is used to indicate that the pattern should be matched only if it is not followed by 'Create Invoice'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the table name, column name, and the condition used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE event_name \n    MATCHES(NOT 'Create Billing Document'~> 'Create Invoice'))\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
