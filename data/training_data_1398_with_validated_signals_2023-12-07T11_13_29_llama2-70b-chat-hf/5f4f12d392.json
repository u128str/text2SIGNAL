The first part of the query selects the columns \"CASE_ID\", \"PO Vendor Name\", and \"CASE_COUNT\" from the table \"defaultview-124\".\n2. The second part of the query groups the data by columns 2, 3, and 4 (i.e., \"CASE_ID\", \"EVENT_NAME\", and \"PO Vendor Name\") and filters the data to only include rows where the value of \"EVENT_NAME\" is in the list (\"Update PO Item Quantity\").\n3. The third part of the query groups the data again by column 2 (i.e., \"PO Vendor Name\") and filters the data to only include rows where the value of \"CASE_COUNT\" is greater than 1.\n4. The fourth part of the query orders the data by column 1 (i.e., \"No. of Cases\") in descending order and limits the result to 10 rows.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, explicitly referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"No. of Cases\", \"PO Vendor Name\"\nFROM (SELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"CASE_COUNT\", CASE_ID, EVENT_NAME, \"PO Vendor Name\"\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\nWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Update PO Item Quantity')\nGROUP BY 2, 3, 4) AS SUB1\nWHERE \"CASE_COUNT\" > 1\nGROUP BY 2\nORDER BY 1 DESC\nLIMIT 10 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
