Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: extracting specific columns from the FLATTEN function.\n\t* FROM clause: specifying the table name as \"defaultview-222\".\n\t* WHERE clause: applying filters on the NetDueDate, event_name, ClearingDate, and NOW() functions.\n\t* GROUP BY clause: grouping the results by the first two columns.\n\t* ORDER BY clause: sorting the results in descending order by the third column.\n\t* LIMIT clause: limiting the number of results to 20.\n2. Translating each component into a human-readable description:\n\t* SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ \"Company Code\" = \"AR_CompanyCode\"\n\t\t+ \"Overdue Category\"\n\t\t+ \"Amount in Global Currency\" = SUM(\"AmountInGlobalCurrency\")\n\t* FROM clause:\n\t\t+ \"defaultview-222\"\n\t* WHERE clause:\n\t\t+ NetDueDate is not null\n\t\t+ event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\n\t\t+ ClearingDate IS NULL\n\t\t+ NOW() >= NetDueDate\n\t* GROUP BY clause:\n\t\t+ Grouping by the first two columns\n\t* ORDER BY clause:\n\t\t+ Sorting in descending order by the third column\n\t* LIMIT clause:\n\t\t+ Limiting the number of results to 20\n3. Combining the descriptions into a single human-readable summary.\n\nThe resulting summary, \"Retrieve the Company Code, Overdue Category, and total Amount in Global Currency for accounts receivable created on or after the current date, with a null Clearing Date, and sorted in descending order by amount,\" accurately describes the purpose of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n \"AR_CompanyCode\"  as \"Company Code\" ,\n\"Overdue Category\", \nSUM(\"AmountInGlobalCurrency\"  ) as \"Amount in Global Currency\"\nFROM FLATTEN (\"defaultview-222\")\n\nWHERE NetDueDate is not null \n\t\tAND event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\n        AND ClearingDate IS NULL\n        AND NOW() >= NetDueDate \n GROUP BY 1,2\n ORDER BY  3 DESC\nLIMIT 20 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
