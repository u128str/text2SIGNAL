Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query filters for rows where \"Risk Class\" is 'Not evaluated' and there is a \"Create Invoice\" event.\n\t* It then uses the MATCHES function to look for rows where the \"Create Invoice\" event is not followed by a \"Receive Payment\" or \"Cancel Invoice\" event.\n4.
