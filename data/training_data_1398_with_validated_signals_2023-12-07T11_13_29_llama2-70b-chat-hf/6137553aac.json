We then determined the calculation being performed in the query:\n\t* The query calculates the ratio of count(distinct \"PO ID\") to count(distinct \"Invoice ID\") and then multiplies the result by 100.\n4. Finally, we constructed the signal_description by describing the calculation in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and intent of the query without having to read the actual query syntax.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(distinct \"PO ID\" )/count(distinct \"Invoice ID\" )*100 \nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
