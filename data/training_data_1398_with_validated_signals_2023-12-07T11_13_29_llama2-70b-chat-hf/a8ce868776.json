{"signal_description": "Calculate average time difference between 'Create Issue' and 'In Progress', 'In Progress' and 'Ready for Review', 'Ready for Review' and 'In Review', and 'In Review' and 'Closed'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate average time difference between 'Create Issue' and 'In Progress', 'In Progress' and 'Ready for Review', 'Ready for Review' and 'In Review', and 'In Review' and 'Closed'.\"\n}\n\nThe signal query is broken down into four parts:\n\n1. The first part calculates the average time difference between 'Create Issue' and 'In Progress'. It does this by selecting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress' and then subtracting the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Issue'.\n2. The second part calculates the average time difference between 'In Progress' and 'Ready for Review'. It does this by selecting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Ready for Review' and then subtracting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress'.\n3. The third part calculates the average time difference between 'Ready for Review' and 'In Review'. It does this by selecting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Review' and then subtracting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Ready for Review'.\n4. The fourth part calculates the average time difference between 'In Review' and 'Closed'. It does this by selecting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Closed' and then subtracting the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Review'.\n\nThe signal query then selects the average of these four calculations and outputs it as a JSON object.\n\nThe table used in the signal query is \"defaultview-217\". The columns used in the query are 'end_time', 'event_name'. The values used in the query are 'Create Issue', 'In Progress', 'Ready for Review', 'In Review', and 'Closed'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue')))) AS \"Create => In Progress\",\n\n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review')))\n    - (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress')))) AS \"In Progress => Ready for Review\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review')))\n    - (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review')))) AS \"Ready for Review => In Review\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed')))\n    - (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review')))) AS \"In Review => Closed\"\n\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
