This is described as \"Retrieve the last end time of 'Create Invoice' events\".\n* The second part of the query selects the last end time of events with the name 'Clear Invoice' and filters out any rows where the event name is not 'Clear Invoice'. This is described as \"Retrieve the last end time of 'Clear Invoice' events\".\n* The third part of the query calculates the difference between the last end time of 'Clear Invoice' events and the first end time of 'Create Invoice' events. This is described as \"Calculate the average cycle time for invoice creation\".\n* The fourth part of the query groups the data by month and orders it in ascending order based on the invoice creation date. This is described as \"Group the data by month and order it in ascending order\".\n* The final part of the query fills in missing values in the time series data using the 'MONTH' function. This is described as \"Fill in missing values in the time series data\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the query without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('MONTH', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Invoice')))) AS \"Invoice creation date\",\n        \n    AVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice'))) \n    - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Invoice')))) AS \"AVG Cycle Time\"     \t\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH')\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
