This is described in the signal_description as \"Retrieve the number of cases (Cases)\".\n* The second part of the query \"sum (\"Consensus Demand\") AS \"Demand\"\" is selecting the sum of the Consensus Demand column from the table \"defaultview-404\".

This is described in the signal_description as \"from the defaultview-404 table\".\n* The fourth part of the query \"Where \"ABC Id\" is not null\" is specifying a condition for the query, only including rows where the ABC Id column is not null. This is described in the signal_description as \"for non-null ABC Ids\".\n* The fifth part of the query \"ORDER BY 3\" is specifying the column to order the results by, in this case the third column.
