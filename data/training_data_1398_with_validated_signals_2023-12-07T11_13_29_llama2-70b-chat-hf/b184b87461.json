Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: AVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Complete Demand Planning') AND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')))) - AVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Start Demand Planning') AND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED'))))\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-404\"\n2.

Identifying the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-404\"\n\t* Column names: EVENT_NAME, Step Status, END_TIME\n\t* Respective values: 'Complete Demand Planning', 'COMPLETED', 'Start Demand Planning', 'COMPLETED'\n4.
