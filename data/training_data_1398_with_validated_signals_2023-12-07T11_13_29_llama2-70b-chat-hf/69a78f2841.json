The first value is the last \"end_time\" of an event with the name \"Create FI Invoice\", and the second value is the first \"end_time\" of an event with the name \"Create PO Item\". The events are filtered by their names using the IN operator. The query uses the FILTER clause to filter the events that match the specified names.\n\nThe query uses the LAST and FIRST functions to get the last and first \"end_time\" values that match the filter conditions. The minus sign (-) operator is used to calculate the difference between the two values. The AVG function is used to calculate the average of the differences.\n\nThe query is executed on the \"defaultview-124\" table, which is assumed to contain the necessary columns and data for the calculation.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation and the tables and columns used in the query. It is written in a human-readable format, with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG(\n(SELECT LAST(\"end_time\") FILTER (WHERE \"event_name\" IN ('Create FI Invoice')))\n-\n(SELECT FIRST(\"end_time\") FILTER (WHERE (\"event_name\" IN ('Create PO Item')) ))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-124\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
