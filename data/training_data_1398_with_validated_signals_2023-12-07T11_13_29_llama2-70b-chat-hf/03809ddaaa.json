Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses the COUNT function to count the number of case_id that meet certain conditions.\n\t* The conditions are specified using the FILTER clause, which filters the data based on the specified conditions.\n\t* The conditions are:\n\t\t+ The last GR creation date is greater than the PO requested delivery date.\n\t\t+ The PO delivery status is received.\n4. Constructing the signal_description by describing the logic of the query in a human-readable format, using the identified column names and values.\n\nThe signal_description is a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, written in a way that a human can easily understand what the query is doing, without having to read the actual query.
