It uses LAG function to calculate the following event and Event Cycle Time, and filters out rows where Event Created By User Type is not in ('System','Service') for Automation Rate calculation. The query groups the results by Event Name and Following event, and orders them by Automation Rate in % descending.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by explaining the query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
