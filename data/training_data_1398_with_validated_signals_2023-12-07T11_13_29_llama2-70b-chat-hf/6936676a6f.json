Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-222\".\n2. Understanding the query's SELECT clause, which is:\nCOUNT (case_id) FILTER (WHERE (\"AR_LastClearingDate\" IS NULL AND \"AR_LastNetDueDate\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()))) / COUNT (case_id) FILTER (WHERE (\"AR_LastClearingDate\" IS NULL)) * 100\n3. Breaking down the query into its component parts:\n\t* The first part of the query is a COUNT() function that counts the number of case_id values that meet certain conditions.\n\t* The conditions are specified in the FILTER clause, which is applied to the result of the COUNT() function.\n\t* The first condition is that \"AR_LastClearingDate\" must be null.\n\t* The second condition is that \"AR_LastNetDueDate\" must be less than the current day (NOW()).\n\t* The second part of the query is another COUNT() function that counts the number of case_id values that meet a different set of conditions.\n\t* The conditions are specified in the FILTER clause, which is applied to the result of the COUNT() function.\n\t* The only condition is that \"AR_LastClearingDate\" must be null.\n\t* The result of the second COUNT() function is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n4. Using this understanding to craft a human-readable description of the query, which is the signal_description.\n\nThe signal_description includes explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
