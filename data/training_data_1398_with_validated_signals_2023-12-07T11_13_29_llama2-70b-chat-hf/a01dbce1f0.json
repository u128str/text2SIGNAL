Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The first component is the SELECT clause, which retrieves the following columns:\n\t\t+ \"SO Item Creation Date\"\n\t\t+ \"Percentage of cases with changes\"\n\t\t+ \"Company Code Name\"\n\t* The second component is the FROM clause, which specifies the table name as \"defaultview-383\"\n\t* The third component is the ORDER BY clause, which sorts the results by the first column in ascending order and fills the gaps in the time series for the month column.\n2. Breaking down each component into smaller parts to understand what each part does:\n\t* The SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Sales Order Item'))) AS \"SO Item Creation Date\" - retrieves the first end time of events with the name 'Create Sales Order Item' and truncates it to the month level.\n\t\t+ COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (ChangeType = 'Update')))) / COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) * 100 AS \"Percentage of cases with changes\" - calculates the percentage of cases with updates by dividing the number of distinct case IDs with updates by the total number of distinct case IDs.\n\t\t+ \"InvoiceCompanyCode\" AS \"Company Code Name\" - retrieves the company code name from the 'InvoiceCompanyCode' column.\n\t* The FROM clause:\n\t\t+ \"defaultview-383\" - specifies the table name.\n\t* The ORDER BY clause:\n\t\t+ ORDER BY 1 ASC FILL TIMESERIES('month') - sorts the results by the first column in ascending order and fills the gaps in the time series for the month column.\n3. Using natural language processing techniques to generate a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, including the table name, column names, and respective values.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what data it retrieves from the table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'month',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name = 'Create Sales Order Item'\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"SO Item Creation Date\",\n  COUNT (DISTINCT CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          BOOL_OR (ChangeType = 'Update')\n      )\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) * 100 AS \"Percentage of cases with changes\",\n  \"InvoiceCompanyCode\" AS \"Company Code Name\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\"\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC FILL TIMESERIES('month') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
