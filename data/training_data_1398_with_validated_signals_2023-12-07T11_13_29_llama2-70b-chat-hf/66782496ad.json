Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: This clause specifies the columns to be included in the output.\n\t* SUM clause: This clause aggregates the values of a column.\n\t* FILTER clause: This clause filters the rows to be processed based on a condition.\n\t* FROM clause: This clause specifies the table to be used in the query.\n2. Breaking down the FILTER clause:\n\t* event_name MATCHES('Delete PO Item'): This condition filters the rows where the value in the 'event_name' column matches the specified string.\n3. Breaking down the SUM clause:\n\t* SUM(\"PO Item Net Order Value in USD\"): This clause aggregates the values of the 'PO Item Net Order Value in USD' column.\n4. Breaking down the multiplication operation:\n\t* * 79.5: This operation multiplies the result of the SUM clause by the specified value.\n5. Combining the components:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed by combining the components above, using natural language to describe the operation.\n\nNote: The table name and column names are explicitly mentioned in the signal_description to provide clarity and make it easier to understand the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\"PO Item Net Order Value in USD\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES('Delete PO Item')\n\t) * 79.5\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
