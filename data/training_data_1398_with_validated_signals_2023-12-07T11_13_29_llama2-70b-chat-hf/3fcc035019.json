This part selects the first 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is 'Assign Reviewer' and then uses the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the date to the month level. This is described in the signal_description as \"Retrieve the month when the Reviewer was added\".\n* The second part of the query is \"AVG( (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress') ) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do')) ) AS \"Duration\"\". This part calculates the average duration between the first 'end_time' of 'Change Status to In Progress' and the first 'end_time' of 'Change Status to To Do' for each group of rows with the same month. This is described in the signal_description as \"Retrieve the average duration between 'Change Status to In Progress' and 'Change Status to To Do' for each month\".\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM \"defaultview-217\"\". This part specifies the table to use for the query, which is \"defaultview-217\".\n* The fourth part of the query is \"WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to To Do' ~> ('Change Status to In Progress'))\". This part filters the rows to only include those where the 'event_name' is either 'Change Status to To Do' or 'Change Status to In Progress'. This is described in the signal_description as \"Filter rows to only include 'Change Status to To Do' and 'Change Status to In Progress'\".\n* The fifth part of the query is \"GROUP BY 1\". This part groups the rows by the first column (which is not explicitly specified in the query). This is described in the signal_description as \"Group the rows by the first column\".\n* The sixth part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1\". This part sorts the rows by the first column in ascending order. This is described in the signal_description as \"Sort the rows by the first column in ascending order\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, describing each part of the query and how it contributes to the overall result.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Assign Reviewer')) AS \"Month when Reviewer added\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress')\n        )\n      \t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n      \t   WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))\n    ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to To Do' ~> ('Change Status to In Progress'))\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
