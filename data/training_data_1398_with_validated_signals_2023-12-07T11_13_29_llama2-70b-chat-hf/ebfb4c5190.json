Next, we identified the column names and their respective values that are used in the query:\n\t* \"TSR_AVGCreationTillApprovalTime\"\n\t* \"TSR_Count\"\n3. We then understood the calculation being performed in the query, which is a simple arithmetic operation:\n\t* Calculate the sum of \"TSR_AVGCreationTillApprovalTime\" column.\n\t* Divide the result by the sum of \"TSR_Count\" column.\n4.
