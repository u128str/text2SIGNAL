This is achieved by using a subquery that calculates the maximum occurrence of event_name and then comparing it to 3.\n* ORDER BY: The query sorts the results by case_id in ascending order (column 1).\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as retrieving specific columns from a table, filtering the data based on a maximum occurrence of an event, and sorting the results by case_id.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT case_id, \"event_name\", \"end_time\", \"Risk Class\" \nFROM \"defaultview-9\"\nWHERE (SELECT MAX(occ)\n       FROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occ) AS sub) > 3\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
