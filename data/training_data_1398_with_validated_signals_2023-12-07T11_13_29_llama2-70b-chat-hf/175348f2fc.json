Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query is selecting a ratio of two counts.\n\t* The first count is filtered by a CASE statement that checks if the 'event_name' column matches the string 'Create Warehouse Task'. If it does, then NULL is returned, otherwise the 'case_id' value is returned.\n\t* The second count is simply the total number of 'case_id' values.\n\t* The ratio is calculated by dividing the first count by the second count and multiplying by 100.\n2. Breaking down the query into more detailed parts:\n\t* The query is selecting from a specific table, \"defaultview-545\".\n\t* The query is using the COUNT function to count the number of rows that match a certain condition.\n\t* The condition is defined using a CASE statement, which checks if the 'event_name' column matches the string 'Create Warehouse Task'.\n\t* If the condition is met, then NULL is returned, otherwise the 'case_id' value is returned.\n\t* The query is using the ELSE clause to return the 'case_id' value when the condition is not met.\n\t* The query is using the COUNT function again to count the total number of 'case_id' values.\n\t* The ratio is calculated by dividing the first count by the second count and multiplying by 100.\n3. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description should clearly explain what the query is doing, in a way that a human can understand.\n\t* The description should reference the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description should be written in a way that a user who knows the table schema and data can understand.\n\t* The description should be concise and easy to read.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description for this SIGNAL query is: \"Calculate the percentage of warehouse tasks created out of all cases, by counting the number of case IDs that match the event name 'Create Warehouse Task' and dividing it by the total number of case IDs, in the 'defaultview-545' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(\nCASE WHEN event_name MATCHES('Create Warehouse Task') THEN null\nELSE case_id\nEND)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
