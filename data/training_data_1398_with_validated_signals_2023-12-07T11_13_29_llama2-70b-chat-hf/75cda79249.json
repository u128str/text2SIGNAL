Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n2. Understanding the query structure:\n\t* SELECT AVG(expression) FROM table_name\n\t* Expression is a subtraction of two subqueries\n\t\t+ First subquery: SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')\n\t\t+ Second subquery: SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create PR Item')\n3. Breaking down the subqueries:\n\t* First subquery:\n\t\t+ Selects the last 'end_time' value for events with 'Create PO Item' as 'event_name'\n\t\t+ Returns a single value\n\t* Second subquery:\n\t\t+ Selects the first 'end_time' value for events with 'Create PR Item' as 'event_name'\n\t\t+ Returns a single value\n4. Analyzing the outer query:\n\t* Selects the average of the difference between the two subquery values\n\t* The AVG() function ignores null values, so if either subquery returns null, the result will be null\n5. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Using the information gathered, create a human-readable description of the signal query\n\t* Include the table name, column names, and respective values (if used in the signal query)\n\t* Use a natural language style to make the description easy to understand\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the signal query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PR Item'))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
