SELECT: The query starts by selecting data from the \"defaultview-9\" table.\n2. COUNT (1) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Invoice'~> 'Receive Payment')): This part of the query counts the number of events in the table where the EVENT_NAME column matches the pattern 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Receive Payment'. The COUNT (1) function returns the number of matching events, and the FILTER clause filters the data to only include events that match the specified pattern.\n3. / COUNT (1): This part of the query divides the number of matching events by the total number of events in the table.\n4. * 100: The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n5. AS \"Standard Invoicing Compliance Rate\": The resulting value is then given the alias \"Standard Invoicing Compliance Rate\".\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing each step in a human-readable format, using the table and column names to provide context.
