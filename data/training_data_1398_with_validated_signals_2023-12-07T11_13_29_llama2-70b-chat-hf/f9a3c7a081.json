Understanding the query's syntax:\n\t* SELECT: Retrieves data from the table.\n\t* AVG: Calculates the average of the selected data.\n\t* (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE (event_name = ('Create Shop Floor Control')))): Retrieves the last end time of events with the name 'Create Shop Floor Control'.\n\t* (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE (event_name = ('Create Production Order')))): Retrieves the first end time of events with the name 'Create Production Order'.\n\t* -: Calculates the difference between the two end times.\n3. Breaking down the query into its main components:\n\t* Calculate the last end time of 'Create Shop Floor Control' events.\n\t* Calculate the first end time of 'Create Production Order' events.\n\t* Calculate the difference between the two end times.\n4. Creating a human-readable description that references the table name, column names, and respective values:\n\t* \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Create Shop Floor Control' event and the first 'Create Production Order' event for the default view-538.\"\n\nThis description explains the purpose of the query and what it does, making it easier for users to understand the Signal query and its intent.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name = ('Create Shop Floor Control'))))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name = ('Create Production Order'))))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-538\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
