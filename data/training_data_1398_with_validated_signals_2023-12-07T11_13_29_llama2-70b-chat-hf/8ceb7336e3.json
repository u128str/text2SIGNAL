Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: AVG( )\n\t* The subqueries: (SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastClearingDate\")) and (SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastCreationDateTime\"))\n\t* The WHERE clause: ((NOW() - LAST(end_time)) < DURATION '60weeks')\n2. Breaking down each subquery:\n\t* The first subquery: (SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastClearingDate\"))\n\t\t+ Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-222\"\n\t\t+ Identifying the column name: \"AR_LastClearingDate\"\n\t\t+ Understanding the context: The subquery selects the last clearing date for all records in the \"defaultview-222\" table where the difference between the current date and the end time is less than 60 weeks.\n\t* The second subquery: (SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastCreationDateTime\"))\n\t\t+ Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-222\"\n\t\t+ Identifying the column name: \"AR_LastCreationDateTime\"\n\t\t+ Understanding the context: The subquery selects the last creation date for all records in the \"defaultview-222\" table where the difference between the current date and the end time is less than 60 weeks.\n3. Understanding the calculation:\n\t* The AVG( ) function calculates the average of the differences between the last clearing date and the last creation date for all records that meet the condition specified in the WHERE clause.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Starting with the phrase \"Calculate the average of the difference between\"\n\t* Adding the column names and respective values: \"the last clearing date (AR_LastClearingDate) and the last creation date (AR_LastCreationDateTime)\"\n\t* Adding the table name: \"for all records in the 'defaultview-222' table\"\n\t* Adding the condition: \"where the difference between the current date and the end time is less than 60 weeks.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and the logic behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastClearingDate\") \n\t\tWHERE ((NOW() - LAST(end_time)) < DURATION '60weeks'))\n\t-(SELECT LAST(\"AR_LastCreationDateTime\")\n\t\tWHERE ((NOW() - LAST(end_time)) < DURATION '60weeks'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-222\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
