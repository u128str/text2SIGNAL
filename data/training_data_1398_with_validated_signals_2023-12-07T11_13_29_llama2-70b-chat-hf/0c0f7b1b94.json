Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects two sums of COUNT(event_name) filtered by EventCreatedByUserType.\n\t* The first sum is filtered by EventCreatedByUserType = 'System', 'Service', or 'Batch Job'.\n\t* The second sum is the total count of event_name.\n\t* The query calculates the percentage by dividing the first sum by the second sum and multiplying by 100.\n2. Breaking down the query into simpler parts:\n\t* The first part is a SELECT statement that retrieves the count of event_name filtered by EventCreatedByUserType.\n\t* The second part is another SELECT statement that retrieves the total count of event_name.\n\t* The third part is a simple arithmetic operation that calculates the percentage.\n3. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* Identifying the main purpose of the query: Calculate the percentage of events created by System, Service, or Batch Job.\n\t* Describing the tables and columns used in the query: defaultview-50, event_name, EventCreatedByUserType.\n\t* Explaining the filtering condition: EventCreatedByUserType = 'System', 'Service', or 'Batch Job'.\n\t* Mentioning the calculation of the percentage: dividing the first sum by the second sum and multiplying by 100.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and logic behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nSUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (\"EventCreatedByUserType\" \n        \tIN ('System','Service','Batch Job')))))\n/ SUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))) \n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-50\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
