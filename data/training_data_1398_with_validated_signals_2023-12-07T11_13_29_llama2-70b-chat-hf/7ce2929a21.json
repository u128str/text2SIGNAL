SELECT: The query starts by selecting two values, which are the result of two separate SELECT statements.\n2. SUM: The first SELECT statement calculates the sum of a column named \"COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\" after applying a filter.\n3. FILTER: The filter is applied to a table named \"defaultview-225\" and it filters the rows where the column \"Event Created By User Type\" is not null and is either 'System' or 'Service'.\n4. SUM: The second SELECT statement calculates the sum of the same column \"COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\" after applying the same filter.\n5. /: The two sums are divided, and the result is multiplied by 100.\n6. FROM: The query specifies the table name \"defaultview-225\" as the source of the data.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description describes the query as calculating the percentage of events created by system or service users out of all events, using the 'defaultview-225' table, by filtering the events where the 'Event Created By User Type' column is not null and is either 'System' or 'Service', and then dividing the result by the total count of events where the 'Event Created By User Type' column is not null, and finally multiplying by 100.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tSUM ((SELECT COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE (\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service') \n        AND (\"Event Created By User Type\" IS NOT NULL)))))\n\t/ SUM ((SELECT COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER(\n    \tWHERE (\"Event Created By User Type\" IS NOT NULL)))) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
