This part is describing the calculation of the number of purchase orders, which is done by counting the number of distinct PO IDs.\n* The third part of the query is \"AVG( (SELECT LAST ('end_time') - FIRST ('end_time')) ) AS 'Avg.

This part is describing the data source and the order of the results.
