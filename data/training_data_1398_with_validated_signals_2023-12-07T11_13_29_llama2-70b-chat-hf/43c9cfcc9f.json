The query selects the average of a subtraction operation, where the subtraction is performed between two values that are obtained by selecting the 'end_time' column from the 'defaultview-217' table, based on specific event names.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* Column names: 'end_time', 'event_name'\n2. Understand the query logic:\n\t* The query calculates the average time difference between two events: 'Create Issue' and 'Change Status to To Do'\n\t* It uses the 'FIRST' function to select the first 'end_time' value for each event\n\t* The 'IN' operator is used to filter the events based on their names\n\t* The subtraction operation is performed between the two event times, and the result is averaged\n3. Craft a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* \"Calculate the average time difference between the 'Create Issue' and 'Change Status to To Do' events, using the 'end_time' column from the 'defaultview-217' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column names, and event names used in the query, making it easy for users to understand what data is being analyzed and how it is being processed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to To Do') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
