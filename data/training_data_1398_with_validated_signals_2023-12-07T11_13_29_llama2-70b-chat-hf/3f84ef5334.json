This part is describing the calculation of the count of cases that meet a certain condition.\n* The condition is described in the next part of the query, which is \"WHERE (Last Inv. Item Due Date - Last Inv. Item Clearing Date > DURATION '5days')\". This part is saying that the last inventory item due date must be more than 5 days after the last inventory item clearing date.\n* The next part of the query is \"FILTER (WHERE (Last Inv.

This part is saying that only cases where the last inventory item clearing date is not null should be included in the calculation.\n* The final part of the query is \"100 * COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE (...)\". This part is describing the calculation of the percentage of cases that meet the condition.
