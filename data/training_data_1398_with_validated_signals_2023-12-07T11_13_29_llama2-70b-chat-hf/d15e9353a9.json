Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-225\".\n2. Identifying the column names and their respective values used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\"\n\t* CASE_ID (which is the primary key of the table)\n3. Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses a COUNT() function to count the number of CASE_IDs that match a certain condition.\n\t* The condition is defined using a CASE statement, which checks if the \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" is before the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\".\n\t* The result of the COUNT() function is then divided by the total number of CASE_IDs that have a non-null \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\".\n\t* The final result is multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The description starts with the phrase \"Calculate the percentage of cases where...\" to clearly convey the purpose of the query.\n\t* The description then lists the specific conditions that must be met for a case to be included in the calculation, using the column names and their respective values.\n\t* The description ends with the table name to specify which table the query is operating on.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it operates on the data in the table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
