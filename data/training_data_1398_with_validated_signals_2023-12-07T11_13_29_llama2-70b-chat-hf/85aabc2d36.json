The query selects the average of a subtraction operation, where the subtraction operation is performed on two separate queries.\n\nThe first query selects the first 'end_time' value from the 'defaultview-217' table where the 'event_name' column contains the value 'Create Issue'. This is done using the 'FIRST' aggregation function, which returns the first value in the column.\n\nThe second query selects the first 'end_time' value from the 'defaultview-217' table where the 'event_name' column contains the value 'Change Status to In Progress'. This is done using the 'FIRST' aggregation function, which returns the first value in the column.\n\nThe two queries are then subtracted from each other, and the result is averaged using the 'AVG' aggregation function.\n\nFinally, the query filters the results to only include rows where the 'event_name' column matches the pattern 'Create Issue' followed by 'Change Status to In Progress'. This is done using the 'MATCHES' operator, which performs a regular expression match.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to In Progress') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
