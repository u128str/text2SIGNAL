Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: `SELECT (1 - ...)`\n\t* The COUNT function: `COUNT(case_id)`\n\t* The FILTER clause: `FILTER (WHERE ...)`\n\t* The DATE_TRUNC function: `DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\")`\n\t* The PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date and PO Item Delivery Completed columns: `\"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\"` and `\"PO Item Delivery Completed\"`\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts and describing each part:\n\t* The first part: `COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\" AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes')`\n\t\t+ This part calculates the number of delivery requests that were completed on time.\n\t\t+ The DATE_TRUNC function rounds the last GR creation date to the nearest day, and the filter clause selects only the rows where the last GR creation date is greater than the PO item last requested delivery date.\n\t\t+ The AND clause selects only the rows where the PO item delivery completed is Yes.\n\t* The second part: `COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes')`\n\t\t+ This part calculates the total number of delivery requests that were completed.\n\t\t+ The filter clause selects only the rows where the PO item delivery completed is Yes.\n\t* The division and multiplication by 100: `(1 - ...)/...*100`\n\t\t+ This part calculates the percentage of delivery requests that were completed on time.\n\t\t+ The division calculates the ratio of the number of delivery requests completed on time to the total number of delivery requests completed.\n\t\t+ The multiplication by 100 converts the ratio to a percentage.\n3.
