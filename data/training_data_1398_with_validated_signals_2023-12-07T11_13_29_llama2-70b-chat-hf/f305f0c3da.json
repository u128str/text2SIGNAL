The first part of the query selects the average of a subquery that calculates the difference between the END_TIME of 'Change Status to In Progress' events and the END_TIME of 'Change Status to To Do' events.\n2. The subquery is filtered by the EVENT_NAME column, which is matched against a regular expression that includes both 'Change Status to To Do' and 'Change Status to In Progress'.\n3. The main query filters the results by the EVENT_NAME column, using the same regular expression as the subquery.\n4. The results are grouped by the IssueType column.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable summary of the query, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG ((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Change Status to In Progress')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Change Status to To Do'))), \"IssueType\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Change Status to To Do' ~> 'Change Status to In Progress')\nGROUP BY 2 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
