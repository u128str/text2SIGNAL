{"signal_description": "Count distinct PO Ids from the 'defaultview-431' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count distinct PO Ids from the 'defaultview-431' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query selects the count of distinct \"PO Id\" from the table \"defaultview-431\". The query uses the COUNT() function with the DISTINCT keyword to count the unique values of the \"PO Id\" column. The table name \"defaultview-431\" is specified in the FROM clause.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we can start by identifying the main components of the query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-431\"\n* The column name: \"PO Id\"\n* The function: COUNT() with DISTINCT\n\nWe can then construct a human-readable description by combining these components into a sentence. For example: \"Count distinct PO Ids from the 'defaultview-431' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column name, and function used in the SIGNAL query, making it easy for users to understand what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT \"PO Id\")\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
