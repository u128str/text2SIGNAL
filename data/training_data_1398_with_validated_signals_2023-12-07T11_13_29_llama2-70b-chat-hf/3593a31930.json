This is described in the signal_description as \"The calculation is based on the difference between the first 'end_time' value where 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Closed' and the first 'end_time' value where 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Review' for each month.\"\n* The third part of the query is \"FILTER ( WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review' ~> 'Change Status to Closed') )\", which is filtering the results to only include rows where the 'event_name' value matches the pattern 'Change Status to In Review' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'. This is described in the signal_description as \"The results are filtered to only include rows where the 'event_name' value matches the pattern 'Change Status to In Review' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'.\"\n* The final part of the query is \"FROM \"defaultview-217\" GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1\", which is retrieving the data from the \"defaultview-217\" table, grouping the results by the first column, and ordering the results by the first column.
