In this case, we are only selecting one column, COUNT(case_id), which is an aggregation of the case_id column.\n* The FILTER clause is used to filter the data based on certain conditions. In this case, we are filtering for rows where the event_name column matches the pattern 'Create PO Item' and is followed by 'Create Goods Receipt' and then either 'Create FI Invoice' or 'Record Invoice Receipt' and finally 'Clear Invoice'. The MATCHES function is used to match the event_name column against the specified pattern. The ~> operator is used to specify the sequence of events.\n* The COUNT(case_id) function is applied to the filtered data to get the count of case_id that match the specified conditions.\n* Finally, we have the / operator, which divides the filtered count by the total count of case_id, and the * 100 operator, which multiplies the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nPutting it all together, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, describing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE event_name MATCHES('Create PO Item'\n    ~> 'Create Goods Receipt'\n    ~> ('Create FI Invoice' | 'Record Invoice Receipt')\n    ~> 'Clear Invoice' $)\n    )\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
