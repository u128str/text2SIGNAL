The query uses the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the end time to the first day of the month, and the COUNT and FILTER functions to calculate the number of events with the desired names. The BOOL_OR function is used to combine the conditions for 'Update' and 'Change' events. Finally, the query uses the timeseries function to fill in missing values in the result set.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"PO Creation Date\",\n\tCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Update%' OR EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Change%'))) \n\t/ COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS \"Change Rate\"\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
