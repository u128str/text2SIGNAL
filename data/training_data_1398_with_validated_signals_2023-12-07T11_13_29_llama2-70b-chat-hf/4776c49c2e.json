Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query is selecting the count of cases where the duration between the 'Clear Invoice' event and the 'Create FI Invoice' event is greater than 22 days.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* We started by identifying the main objective of the query, which is to count the number of cases that meet a certain condition.\n\t* We then described the condition, which involves the duration between two events being greater than 22 days.\n\t* We mentioned the table name and column names used in the query to provide context.\n\t* Finally, we combined all the information into a single sentence that summarizes the SIGNAL query in a human-readable format.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) AS \"No. of Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice') > DURATION '22DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
