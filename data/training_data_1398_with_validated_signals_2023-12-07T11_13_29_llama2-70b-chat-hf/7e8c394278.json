The description includes the following information:\n\n* The purpose of the query (selecting the sum of AmountInGlobalCurrency for accounts receivable created between different date ranges)\n* The date ranges used in the query (1. Due, 2. 0-7 days, 3. 8-14 days, 4. 15-30 days, 5. 31-60 days, 6. 61-90 days, 7. >90 days)\n* The column used for the overdue category (Overdue Category) and how it is computed (using a CASE statement that checks the difference between NOW() and NetDueDate)\n* The column used for the sum of AmountInGlobalCurrency (#Receivables)\n* The filters applied to the data (NetDueDate is not null, event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable', ClearingDate is null, and NOW() >= NetDueDate)\n* The sorting order of the result (ascending by Overdue Category)", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCASE \n\nWHEN \n\t\t NOW() = NetDueDate THEN '1.
