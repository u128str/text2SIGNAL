Item Clearing Date\" IS NULL and \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())).\n\t* Grouping of data by a specific column (\"Company Code Name\").\n\t* Ordering of data by a specific column (\"Invoice Amount in $\") in descending order.\n\t* Limiting the output to a specific number of rows (10).\n5.
