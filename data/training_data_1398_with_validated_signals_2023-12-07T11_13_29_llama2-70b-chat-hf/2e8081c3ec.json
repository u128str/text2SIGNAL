In this case, we are only interested in the COUNT of the \"case_id\" column.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the output. There are two filters applied here:\n\t+ The first filter is applied using the WHERE clause, which specifies that the value in the \"Consensus Demand Delivered\" column must be equal to the value in the \"Consensus Demand\" column.\n\t+ The second filter is applied using the AND keyword, which specifies that the value in the \"MONTH\" column must be greater than or equal to the current month, and the difference between the \"MONTH\" column and the current month must be less than 320 days.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table that we are querying.
