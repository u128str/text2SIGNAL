The first part of the query is SELECT AVG(..), which indicates that the query is calculating an average value.\n2. The next part is (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name LIKE 'GR%')), which selects the first end_time value where the event_name is like 'GR%'. This part is extracting the first time point when an event with a name starting with 'GR' occurred.\n3. The minus sign (-) indicates that the query is subtracting a value from the previous value.\n4. The next part is (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Released')), which selects the last end_time value where the event_name is equal to 'Released'. This part is extracting the last time point when an event with the name 'Released' occurred.\n5.
