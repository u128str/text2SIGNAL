The events are 'Receive Invoice' and 'Create PO Item'. The query first filters the events by their names and then calculates the time difference between the last 'Receive Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance.\n\nThe query uses the following tables and columns:\n\n* \"defaultview-545\" table: This table contains the process instance data.\n* EVENT_NAME column: This column contains the name of the event.\n* END_TIME column: This column contains the end time of the event.\n\nThe query first filters the events by their names using the FILTER clause. It selects the last 'Receive Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance. Then, it calculates the time difference between the two events using the minus sign (-). Finally, it selects the average of the time differences for all process instances using the AVG function.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))      \nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Receive Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
