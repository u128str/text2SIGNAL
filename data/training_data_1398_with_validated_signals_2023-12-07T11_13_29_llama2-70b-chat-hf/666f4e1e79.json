In this case, we want to include a column called \"case_id\".\n* Next, we have the COUNT function, which counts the number of rows in the table that match a certain condition. In this case, the condition is specified using the FILTER clause, which filters the rows based on the value of the \"event_name\" column.\n* The FILTER clause uses the MATCHES operator to specify a pattern that the \"event_name\" column must match. In this case, the pattern is 'Remove Dunning Block' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n* The division operator is used to divide the count of rows that match the first pattern by the count of rows that match the second pattern.\n* Finally, the result is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-529\" is specified in the FROM clause, which indicates the table that the query should operate on.\n\nThe column names \"case_id\", \"event_name\" are used in the query, and their respective values are the values in the \"case_id\" and \"event_name\" columns of the \"defaultview-529\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name \n    MATCHES('Remove Dunning Block' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\n)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name \n    MATCHES('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice'))\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-529\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
