{"signal_description": "Count the number of case_id where the event_name does not match the pattern 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice' followed by 'Due Date passed' in the table 'defaultview-59'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count the number of case_id where the event_name does not match the pattern 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice' followed by 'Due Date passed' in the table 'defaultview-59'.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using the SELECT statement, which retrieves data from the \"defaultview-59\" table. The COUNT function is used to count the number of case_id that match the filter condition. The filter condition is defined using the NOT operator, which negates the result of the MATCHES function. The MATCHES function checks if the event_name column contains a specific pattern. The pattern is defined using the ~> operator, which indicates a sequence of events. In this case, the pattern is 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice' followed by 'Due Date passed'. The NOT operator negates the result of the MATCHES function, so the query will return all case_id that do not match this pattern.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve data from the \"defaultview-59\" table.\n2. Count the number of case_id that match the filter condition.\n3. Define the filter condition as the negation of the result of the MATCHES function.\n4. Use the MATCHES function to check if the event_name column contains the specified pattern.\n5. Negate the result of the MATCHES function using the NOT operator.\n\nBased on these steps, we can construct the signal_description as: \"Count the number of case_id where the event_name does not match the pattern 'Create Invoice' followed by 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice' followed by 'Due Date passed' in the table 'defaultview-59'.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE NOT (event_name MATCHES('Create Invoice' \t~> 'Post Invoice' \t~> 'Clear Invoice' \t~> 'Due Date passed')))\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
