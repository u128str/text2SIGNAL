The first line of the query selects the quarterly truncated date from the last end time of the event. This is used to group the data by quarter.\n2. The second line calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first end time of 'Create PR item' events from the last end time of 'Approve PR item' events, and then aggregating the result by quarter.\n3. The third line selects the \"PO Item Line Type\" column from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n4. The final line orders the results by the first column (quarter) in ascending order.\n\nBased on these components, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query. It includes references to the table name (\"defaultview-545\"), column names (\"DATE_TRUNC\", \"END_TIME\", \"EVENT_NAME\", and \"PO Item Line Type\"), and respective values (quarter, cycle time, and PO Item Line Type).
