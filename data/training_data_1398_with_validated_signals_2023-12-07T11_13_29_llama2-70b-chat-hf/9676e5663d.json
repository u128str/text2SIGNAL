In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The next part of the query is the AVG() function, which calculates the average value of the expression that follows.\n* The expression is a subquery that uses the LAST() function to retrieve the last occurrence of the 'Release PO' event, and the FILTER() function to filter the results to only include events with the specified name.\n* The subquery is then subtracted from another subquery that uses the FIRST() function to retrieve the first occurrence of the 'Create PO Item' event, and again uses the FILTER() function to filter the results.\n* The resulting difference is then wrapped in another subquery that uses the FILTER() function to filter the results to only include process instances from the 'defaultview-124' table.\n* Finally, the query uses the FROM clause to specify the table to query, which in this case is also 'defaultview-124'.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Release PO'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n   )\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
