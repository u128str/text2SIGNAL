The first part of the query uses a SELECT statement to retrieve the last 'end_time' value for events with the name 'Create PO Item'. This is done using the LAST() function, which returns the last value of a specified column.\n2. The second part of the query uses a SELECT statement to retrieve the first 'end_time' value for events with the name 'Create PR Item'. This is done using the FIRST() function, which returns the first value of a specified column.\n3. The two SELECT statements are then subtracted from each other to calculate the time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event.\n4. The resulting value is then wrapped in an AVG() function, which calculates the average of the value.\n5. Finally, the query is executed on the \"defaultview-124\" view, which is specified in the FROM clause.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation being performed, including the table name, column names, and event names used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PR Item'))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
