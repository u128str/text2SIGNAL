SELECT: The query starts by selecting a column from the table.\n2. COUNT(case_id): The selected column is the \"case_id\" column, and the aggregation function COUNT is applied to it.\n3. FILTER (WHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'): A filter is applied to the results of the COUNT aggregation. The filter checks if the difference between the \"Actual Delivery Date\" and \"Scheduled Finish Date\" columns is greater than 0 seconds.\n4. / count(case_id): The result of the filter is then divided by the total count of \"case_id\" values.\n5. *100: The result of the division is then multiplied by 100.\n6.
