SELECT: The query starts with a SELECT statement, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. (AVG((SELECT last(end_time)) - (SELECT first(end_time))) : This part of the query calculates the average time difference between the last and first end time of events. The AVG function is used to calculate the average, and the last and first end times are selected from the table using the SELECT statement.\n3. FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))) : This part of the query filters the data to only include events created by users of type 'System' or 'Service'. The BOOL_OR function is used to check if the \"Event Created By User Type\" column contains either 'System' or 'Service'.\n4. - (AVG((SELECT last(end_time)) - (SELECT first(end_time))) : This part of the query calculates the average time difference between the last and first end time of events created by users of type 'Dialog'. The calculation is similar to the previous one, but with a different filter.\n5. FROM \"defaultview-124\" : This part of the query specifies the table to use for the calculation. The table name is \"defaultview-124\".\n\nBy combining these parts, we get the overall description of the SIGNAL query, which is calculating the average time difference between the last and first end time of events created by users of type 'System' or 'Service' minus the average time difference between the last and first end time of events created by users of type 'Dialog'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(AVG((SELECT last(end_time)) - (SELECT first(end_time))) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))))\n-\n(AVG((SELECT last(end_time)) - (SELECT first(end_time))) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" = 'Dialog'))))\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
