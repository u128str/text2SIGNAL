The first value is the last 'End Time' of events named 'Remove Dunning Block', and the second value is the first 'End Time' of events named 'Post Invoice'. The events are selected from the 'defaultview-529' table.\n\nThe query uses the SELECT LAST and SELECT FIRST functions to retrieve the desired values. The FILTER function is used to filter the events based on their names. The - operator is used to subtract the first 'End Time' from the last 'End Time' to get the difference. Finally, the AVG function is used to calculate the average of the differences.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by explaining what the query does, referring to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Remove Dunning Block'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')))) \n        \nFROM \"defaultview-529\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
