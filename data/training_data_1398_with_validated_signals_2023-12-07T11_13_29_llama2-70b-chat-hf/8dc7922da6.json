This part counts the number of case IDs that have an event name containing the word 'Update'. The Filter clause is used to apply the ILIKE operator with the '%Update%' pattern to the event_name column.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create PO Item'))\". This part counts the number of case IDs that have an event name equal to 'Create PO Item'.\n* The third part of the query is \"/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create PO Item'))\". This part divides the first count by the second count.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"* 100\". This part multiplies the result of the division by 100.\n\nThe signal_description describes each part of the query in a human-readable format, using the table and column names, and the respective values used in the query.
