SELECT COUNT(case_id): This line retrieves the count of the 'case_id' column in the 'defaultview-225' table.\n2. FILTER(WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Change Type\" ILIKE '%Update%'))): This line filters the rows where the value in the 'Change Type' column is like '%Update%'. The BOOL_OR function returns true if any value in the column matches the pattern, and false otherwise. The WHERE clause filters the rows based on this condition.\n3. / COUNT(case_id) * 100: This line divides the count of 'case_id' by 100. This is done to express the result as a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description describes the query as retrieving the percentage of update changes from the 'defaultview-225' table, by first filtering the rows with update changes and then dividing the count of case_id by 100.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Change Type\" ILIKE '%Update%')))\n    /\n    COUNT(case_id) * 100 \nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
