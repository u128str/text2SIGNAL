Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Identifying the column names: CASE_ID, END_TIME, EVENT_NAME\n3. Understanding the logic of the query:\n\t* The query uses a subquery to select the last END_TIME for events with name 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item'\n\t* The difference between the two END_TIMEs is calculated\n\t* The difference is compared to a duration of 3 days\n\t* If the difference is greater than 3 days, the CASE_ID is counted\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Using a natural language style, the description explains the purpose of the query\n\t* The description references the table and column names\n\t* The description includes the logic of the query, using phrases such as \"where the difference between\" and \"is greater than\" to convey the meaning of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(CASE_ID)\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - \n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item') > DURATION '3DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
