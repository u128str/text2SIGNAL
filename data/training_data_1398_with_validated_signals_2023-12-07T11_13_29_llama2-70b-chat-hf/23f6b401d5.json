This indicates that the query is calculating a percentage, where 1 represents 100% and the value inside the parentheses represents the percentage of requests that were completed on time.\n* The next part of the query is `COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\" AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes')`. This part of the query calculates the count of case IDs (i.e., delivery requests) that meet certain conditions. The conditions are:\n\t+ The last GR creation date is after the requested delivery date.\n\t+ The delivery status is 'Yes'.\n* The third part of the query is `COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes')`. This part of the query calculates the count of case IDs where the delivery status is 'Yes'.\n* The final part of the query is `) / COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes')`. This part of the query divides the count of case IDs that meet the conditions by the total count of case IDs where the delivery status is 'Yes'.\n* The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description explains the calculation performed by the SIGNAL query, which is to find the percentage of delivery requests that were completed on time, considering only requests where the last GR creation date is after the requested delivery date and the delivery status is 'Yes'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  (1 - \n      COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n          WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Item Last Requested Delivery Date\"\n          AND \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n          )\n      /\n      COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n          WHERE \"PO Item Delivery Completed\" = 'Yes'\n          )\n      )\n  * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
