Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query is selecting a count of case IDs that match a certain event name, and dividing it by the total number of case IDs.\n\t* The query is using the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n2. Breaking down the query into its constituent parts:\n\t* The first part of the query is selecting a count of case IDs that match the event name 'Create Warehouse Task'. This is done using a CASE statement, where the event name is matched using the MATCHES function. If the event name matches, then null is returned, otherwise the case ID is returned.\n\t* The second part of the query is selecting the total number of case IDs. This is done using a simple COUNT function.\n\t* The third part of the query is dividing the count of case IDs that match the event name by the total number of case IDs, and multiplying the result by 100.\n3. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed by describing the main components of the query in a human-readable format.\n\t* The description starts by stating the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the percentage of warehouse tasks created out of all cases.\n\t* The description then describes the table used in the query, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n\t* The description then describes the two main parts of the query: counting the number of case IDs that match the event name 'Create Warehouse Task', and dividing it by the total number of case IDs.\n\t* Finally, the description is wrapped in curly braces to indicate that it is a JSON object.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(\nCASE WHEN event_name MATCHES('Create Warehouse Task') THEN null\nELSE case_id\nEND)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
