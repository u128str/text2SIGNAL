{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time of events, where the occurrence of the event name is greater than 1, in the defaultview-59 table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time of events, where the occurrence of the event name is greater than 1, in the defaultview-59 table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its components and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n1. SELECT: The query starts with a SELECT statement, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. AVG: The first item in the SELECT list is an AVG function. This means we are calculating the average of a set of values.\n3. (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)): The AVG function takes the difference between the last and first end time of events as its input. This difference is calculated using two subqueries that select the last and first end time, respectively.\n4. FILTER: The result of the AVG function is then filtered using a BOOL_OR function. This filter selects only the rows where the occurrence of the event name is greater than 1.\n5. FROM \"defaultview-59\": The query selects data from the \"defaultview-59\" table.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time of events, where the occurrence of the event name is greater than 1, in the defaultview-59 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))\n)\n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM(SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub)\n\t\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
