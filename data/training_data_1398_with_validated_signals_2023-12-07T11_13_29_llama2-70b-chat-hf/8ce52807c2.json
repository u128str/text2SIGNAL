Sort the results in descending order.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its component parts and describing each step in a human-readable format.\n\n1. SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Automation rate\" and \"Division\".\n2. COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog')):\nThis part of the query calculates the number of events created by a user type other than 'Dialog'. The COUNT function counts the number of events, and the FILTER clause filters out events created by 'Dialog' user type.\n3. / (COUNT (EVENT_NAME)):\nThis part of the query calculates the total number of events. The COUNT function counts the number of events, and the result is divided by the total number of events.\n4. * 100:\nThis part of the query multiplies the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n5. FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\"):\nThis part of the query specifies the table to use for the query. The table is named \"defaultview-183\".\n6. WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order':\nThis part of the query filters the results to only include events with the name 'Create Process Order'.\n7. order by 1 desc:\nThis part of the query sorts the results in descending order based on the first column.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog'))) / (COUNT (EVENT_NAME)) * 100\nas \"Automation rate\", \"Division\"\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\nWHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order'\norder by 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
