Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-299\"\n2. Understanding the query's logic:\n\t* Calculate the average time difference between two events: 'Personal Data Change WF Rejected' and 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated'\n\t* Use the LAST and FIRST aggregate functions to get the last/first end time for each event\n\t* Filter the events by their names\n3. Breaking down the query into its components:\n\t* SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ AVG (expression)\n\t* Expression:\n\t\t+ Subtraction of two expressions\n\t\t\t- First expression:\n\t\t\t\t+ SELECT LAST (END_TIME)\n\t\t\t\t+ FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Rejected'))\n\t\t\t- Second expression:\n\t\t\t\t+ SELECT FIRST (END_TIME)\n\t\t\t\t+ FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))\n4. Creating a human-readable description:\n\t* Start with a brief summary of the query's purpose\n\t* Mention the table name and the column(s) used in the query\n\t* Explain the logic of the query, including any filters or aggregations used\n\t* End with a brief conclusion or summary of the query's result\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query's purpose and logic, making it easier for users to understand the query and its result.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Rejected'))) \n- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))))  \nFROM \"defaultview-299\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
