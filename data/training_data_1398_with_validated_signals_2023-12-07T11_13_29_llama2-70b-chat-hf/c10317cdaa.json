Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('month', end_time) AS \"Change Date\": Extracting the column name and its value.\n\t* COUNT (DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") AS \"# Changes\": Extracting the column name and its value.\n3. Breaking down the FROM clause:\n\t* FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\"): Identifying the table name.\n4. Breaking down the WHERE clause:\n\t* EVENT_NAME LIKE '%Sales%': Identifying the filter condition.\n\t* ChangeType = 'Update': Identifying the filter condition.\n5. Breaking down the ORDER BY clause:\n\t* 1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('Month'): Identifying the sorting criteria.\n\t* NULL: Identifying the null value filling criteria.\n6.
