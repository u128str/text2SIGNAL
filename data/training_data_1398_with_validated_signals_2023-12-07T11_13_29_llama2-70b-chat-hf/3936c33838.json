In this case, we are interested in the EVENT_NAME and the count of the CASE_ID columns. The COUNT function is used to count the number of unique CASE_ID values for each EVENT_NAME.\n\nThe FROM clause specifies the table to be queried, which is FLATTEN(\"defaultview-225\"). The FLATTEN function is used to flatten the data in the table into a single row per event, which allows us to perform aggregation operations on the data.\n\nThe ORDER BY clause specifies that the results should be sorted in descending order based on the count of CASE_ID values for each EVENT_NAME.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should summarize the query as retrieving distinct event names and counting the number of case IDs for each event, ordered by the count of case IDs in descending order.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DISTINCT EVENT_NAME,  COUNT('case_id') AS \"No# cases\" FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-225\")\nORDER BY 2 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
