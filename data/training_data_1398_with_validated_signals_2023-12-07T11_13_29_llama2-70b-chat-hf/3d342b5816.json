SELECT clause: We are selecting the average of a calculated field.\n2. AVG() function: The calculated field is the difference between the last and first occurrence of events.\n3. SELECT clause (nested): We are selecting the last occurrence of events.\n4. FIRST() function: We are selecting the first occurrence of events.\n5. FILTER clause: We are filtering the results to only include events where the occurrence is greater than 1.\n6. BOOL_OR() function: We are checking if the occurrence is greater than 1.\n7. OCCURRENCE() function: We are calculating the occurrence of events.\n8. FROM clause: We are selecting from the table \"defaultview-545\".\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining the information from each clause and function in a human-readable format, with explicit reference to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) - FIRST(END_TIME))) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1) \n    \tFROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(EVENT_NAME) AS occurrence) AS sub))\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
