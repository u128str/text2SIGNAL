The first part of the query is a SELECT statement that retrieves the count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" from a subquery.\n2. The subquery is defined using a SELECT statement that retrieves the \"Last Invoice Id\", \"PO Item Supplier ID\", \"Last Invoice Date\", and a COUNT(\"Last Invoice Id\") column named \"DuplicateCount\".\n3. The subquery groups the results by the first three columns.\n4. The outer query filters the results of the subquery to only include rows where the \"DuplicateCount\" is greater than 1.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to accurately reflect the intent of the SIGNAL query.
