The query selects the average of the time difference between two events: the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event. The events are filtered based on their names, and the time difference is calculated using the 'LAST' and 'FIRST' aggregate functions.\n\nThe query uses the 'defaultview-471' table, which is assumed to contain columns representing the event names, start and end times, and possibly other relevant information. The 'WHERE' clause filters the events to only include those where the event name matches the pattern 'Create PR Item' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n\nThe Signal summary describes the calculation performed by the query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PR Item'))))\n        \nFROM \"defaultview-471\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PR Item' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
