Reading the SIGNAL query and identifying the tables, columns, and filters used.\n2. Understanding the logic of the query, which involves calculating the percentage of events created by system or service users out of all events.\n3. Breaking down the query into its component parts, such as the select statements, filters, and calculations.\n4. Using human-readable language to describe each part of the query, including the table and column names, filter conditions, and calculations.\n5. Combining the descriptions of each part into a single, coherent sentence that summarizes the entire query.\n6.
