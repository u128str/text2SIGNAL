In this case, the column selected is COUNT(case_id).\n* FILTER: The query then applies a filter to the selected column(s). The filter is defined using the WHERE clause.\n* WHERE: The WHERE clause specifies the condition for which rows to include in the result set. In this case, the condition is that the difference between the current time and the last updated time (represented by the LAST(end_time) function) is greater than 21 days, and the first event name (represented by the FIRST(event_name) function) is not in a list of specified values.\n* FILTER (subquery): The subquery within the FILTER clause filters the event names that are not in the list of specified values.\n* AND: The AND operator is used to combine the two conditions in the WHERE clause.\n* FROM: The query specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved.
