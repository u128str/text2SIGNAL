The cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first 'Post Invoice' event time from the last 'Clear Invoice' event time for each invoice.\n* The fourth part of the query uses a subquery to filter the results to only include invoices with a 'Post Invoice' event.\n* The fifth part of the query uses ORDER BY to sort the results by month.\n\nThe signal_description includes explicit references to the table name (\"defaultview-225\"), column names (\"END_TIME\", \"EVENT_NAME\", \"Inv.
