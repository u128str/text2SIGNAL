This subquery is filtered using the \"IN\" operator to specify the desired user types and event names.\n* The second part of the query is another subquery that selects the count of event_name where the event name is GI for order. This subquery is not filtered, so it returns the total count of GI for order events.\n* The third part of the query divides the result of the first subquery by the result of the second subquery. This calculates the percentage of GI for order events created by the specified user types out of all GI for order events.\n* The final part of the query multiplies the result by 100 to express the percentage as a whole number.\n\nWith this understanding, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.
