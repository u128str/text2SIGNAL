SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: COUNT(case_id) and COUNT(case_id) multiplied by 55.47.\n2. FILTER clause:\nThe first filter condition is \"Forecast Open Output\" > 0. This means that only rows where the value in the \"Forecast Open Output\" column is greater than zero will be considered.\nThe second filter condition is (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) > \"MONTH\". This means that only rows where the current month (obtained using the NOW() function) is greater than the value in the \"MONTH\" column will be considered.\nThe third filter condition is (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) - \"MONTH\") < DURATION '200days'. This means that only rows where the difference between the current month and the month in the \"MONTH\" column is less than 200 days will be considered.\n3. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the table \"defaultview-404\".\n4.
