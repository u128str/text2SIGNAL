This is summarized as \"Retrieve the number of cases (Cases)\".\n* The second part of the query is \"avg(Basic Finish Date - Basic Start Date) as Cycle Time,\" which calculates the average duration between the \"Basic Finish Date\" and \"Basic Start Date\" columns. This is summarized as \"average cycle time (Cycle Time)\".\n* The third part of the query is \"Division,\" which retrieves the values in the \"Division\" column. This is summarized as \"and division\".\n* The final part of the query is \"FROM defaultview-183,\" which specifies the table to query. This is summarized as \"from the 'defaultview-183' table\".\n* The \"order by 1 desc\" clause is not explicitly mentioned in the signal_description, but it is implied by the mention of \"Order the results by Cases in descending order.\"\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components of the query and the table and columns involved.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) as Cases, avg(\n\"Basic Finish Date\"  - \"Basic Start Date\" \n) as \"Cycle Time\", \"Division\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\norder by 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
