{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of distinct 'Inv.

Accounting Document Number' values from the 'defaultview-133' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is quite straightforward. It selects the count of distinct values in the column named \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\" from a table named \"defaultview-133\".\n\nTo create the human-readable description, we can start by mentioning the table name, which is \"defaultview-133\". Then, we can specify the column name, which is \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\", and mention that we want to retrieve the count of its distinct values. Finally, we can wrap the description in curly braces to conform to the expected JSON format.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. Start with the table name: \"defaultview-133\"\n2. Mention the column name: \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\"\n3. Specify the operation: \"COUNT(DISTINCT)\"\n4. Close the JSON object with a curly brace.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what data the query is retrieving and how it's being processed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Inv.
