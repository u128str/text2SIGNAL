In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The next part of the query is the AVG() function, which calculates the average value of the expression that follows.\n* The expression is a subquery that uses the LAST() function to retrieve the last occurrence of the 'Create Goods Receipt' event, and the FILTER clause to filter the events based on the event name.\n* The subquery is then subtracted from another subquery that uses the FIRST() function to retrieve the first occurrence of the 'Release PO' event, and again, the FILTER clause to filter the events based on the event name.\n* The subtraction operation yields a set of time differences between the two events.\n* Finally, the query uses the FROM clause to specify the table to query, which in this case is \"defaultview-124\".\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the last 'Create Goods Receipt' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-124' table.\n2. Retrieve the first 'Release PO' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-124' table.\n3. Calculate the time difference between the last 'Create Goods Receipt' event and the first 'Release PO' event for each process instance.\n4. Calculate the average time difference across all process instances.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and human-readable description of the query, highlighting the key elements of the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Release PO'))\n   )\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
