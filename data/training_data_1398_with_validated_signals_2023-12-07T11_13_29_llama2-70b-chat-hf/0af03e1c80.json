PO Items\\\"\": The first column selected is the count of the \"case_id\" column, which is aliased as \"No of. PO Items\".\n* \"AVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PR Item')))) AS \\\"AVG Cycle Time\\\"\": The second column selected is the average of the difference between the last end time of events with the name \"Pay Invoice\" and the first end time of events with the name \"Create PR Item\". This calculation is performed using a subquery that filters the events by their names and then selects the last or first end time, depending on the event name. The result is then aliased as \"AVG Cycle Time\".\n* \"\\\"?PO Item Supplier ID\\\"\": The third column selected is the value of the \"PO Item Supplier ID\" column.\n* \"FROM \\\"defaultview-431\\\"\": The query selects data from the \"defaultview-431\" table.\n* \"WHERE \\\"Commodity Id\\\" IS NOT NULL AND EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PR Item' ~> 'Pay Invoice')\": The query filters the data to show only records where the \"Commodity Id\" is not null and the \"EVENT_NAME\" matches the pattern \"Create PR Item\" followed by \"Pay Invoice\".
