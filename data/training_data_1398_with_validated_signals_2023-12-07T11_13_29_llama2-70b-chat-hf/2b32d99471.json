SELECT clause:\nThe query selects three columns: \"Month\", \"Percentage of Automated Events\", and \"Company\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"Month\", is created using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the date to the first day of the month. The function takes two arguments: the first is the column to truncate, which is \"end_time\", and the second is the truncation unit, which is \"month\".\n3. FIRST function:\nThe second column, \"Percentage of Automated Events\", is calculated using the FIRST function, which returns the first value that matches the filter condition. The filter condition is defined as \"EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')\".\n4. SUM and FILTER functions:\nThe third column, \"Company\", is selected from the table \"defaultview-225\".\n5. WHERE clause:\nThe query filters the data to only include events with a non-null company code text.\n6. ORDER BY clause:\nThe data is ordered by the first column, \"Month\", in ascending order, with nulls first.\n7. FILL function:\nThe query uses the FILL function to fill in missing values in the time series data.\n8. NULLS FIRST:\nThe NULLS FIRST keyword is used to specify that null values should be treated as the lowest value in the column when sorting.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and functionality.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\tDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST (end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')))) AS \"Month\",\n    (SUM ((SELECT COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE (\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))))\n        / SUM((SELECT COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" IS NOT NULL))) * 100\n        ) \n        AS \"Percentage of Automated Events\"\n\t,\"Inv.
