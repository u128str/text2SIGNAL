SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'Completed'): This part of the query calculates the number of projects that have a 'Completed' status. The COUNT function counts the number of unique values in the 'case_id' column, and the FILTER clause filters the data to only include rows where the 'Project_StageText' column has the value 'Completed'.\n3. / COUNT(case_id): This part of the query calculates the total number of projects by counting the number of unique values in the 'case_id' column.\n4. * 100: This part of the query multiplies the result of the previous calculation by 100, which converts the result into a percentage.\n5. FROM \"defaultview-197\": This part of the query specifies the table from which the data should be fetched. The table name is \"defaultview-197\".\n\nBy combining these parts, we get the overall signal description: \"Calculate the percentage of completed projects out of all projects.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'Completed')\n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
