Cycle time\".\n* The next part is \"PO Item Plant\", which tells us that we are selecting a column named \"PO Item Plant\" from the table.\n* The final part of the query is ORDER BY 1 DESC, which sorts the results by the first column (in this case, the \"No. of Cases\" column) in descending order.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the signal_description, which provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"No. of Cases\", \nAVG ((SELECT LAST (\"end_time\") - FIRST (\"end_time\"))) AS \"Avg.
