Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT(DISTINCT \"EVENT_NAME\")\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-124\"\n\t* WHERE clause: NOW() - (SELECT LAST(END_TIME)) > DURATION '120DAYS'\n2. Breaking down the WHERE clause into its components:\n\t* NOW(): The current time.\n\t* LAST(END_TIME): The last END_TIME value in the table.\n\t* DURATION '120DAYS': A duration of 120 days.\n3. Combining the components into a human-readable description:\n\t* \"Count the number of unique 'EVENT_NAME' values in the 'defaultview-124' table, where the difference between the current time and the last 'END_TIME' value is greater than 120 days.\"\n\nThe description explicitly references the table name (\"defaultview-124\"), column names (\"EVENT_NAME\", \"END_TIME\"), and the respective values (NOW(), LAST(END_TIME), DURATION '120DAYS'). It also includes the query's objective (counting the number of unique EVENT_NAME values) and the condition for which the query is applied (the difference between the current time and the last END_TIME value being greater than 120 days).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT (DISTINCT \"EVENT_NAME\") AS \"No. of Variants\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\nNOW() - (SELECT LAST(END_TIME)) > DURATION '120DAYS'\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
