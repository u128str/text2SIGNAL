Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the Signal query:\n\t* CASE_ID: not explicitly mentioned, but it's the column that is being counted.\n\t* END_TIME: mentioned twice, once for the event named 'Release PO' and once for the event named 'Create PO Item'.\n\t* EVENT_NAME: mentioned twice, once for the event named 'Release PO' and once for the event named 'Create PO Item'.\n\t* DURATION '3DAYS': mentioned once, as the threshold for the difference between the two END_TIME values.\n3. Understanding the logic of the Signal query:\n\t* The query is counting the number of CASE_IDs that meet a certain condition.\n\t* The condition is that the difference between the last END_TIME of an event with name 'Release PO' and the last END_TIME of an event with name 'Create PO Item' is greater than 3 days.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* We started by mentioning the table name, \"defaultview-124\".\n\t* We then described the condition in a natural language way, using the column names and respective values.\n\t* We finished by specifying the threshold for the difference between the two END_TIME values.\n\nNote: The above signal_description is just one possible way to summarize the given Signal query.
