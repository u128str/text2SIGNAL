Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-59\".\n2. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* case_id: not explicitly mentioned, but it's the primary key of the table and is used in the COUNT() function.\n\t* event_name: mentioned in the WHERE clause, with the condition IN ('Update Payment Term')\n\t* Event Created By User Type: mentioned in the WHERE clause, with the condition = 'Dialog'\n3. Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses COUNT() to count the number of events that match the conditions in the WHERE clause.\n\t* The result of the COUNT() function is then divided by the total number of cases (which is assumed to be the number of rows in the table).\n\t* The final result is then multiplied by 100.\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a brief description of the table, \"For every case in the 'defaultview-59' table,\"\n\t* Then describe the condition for which events to count, \"count the number of events where the event name is 'Update Payment Term' or the event was created by a user type of 'Dialog'.\"\n\t* Next, describe the calculation, \"divide that count by the total number of cases, and multiply by 100.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the logic and purpose of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name IN ('Update Payment Term')) AND BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" = 'Dialog')))\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
