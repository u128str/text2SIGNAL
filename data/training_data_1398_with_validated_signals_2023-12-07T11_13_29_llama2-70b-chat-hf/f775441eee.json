SELECT: The query starts by selecting a set of rows from the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n2. COUNT(case_id): The query counts the number of distinct 'case_id' values in the selected rows.\n3. FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name ILIKE '%Update%'))): The query filters the rows to only include those where the 'event_name' column contains the string '%Update%'. This is done using a subquery that selects all rows where the 'event_name' column matches the pattern, and then uses the BOOL_OR function to convert the result to a boolean value.\n4. COUNT(case_id) * 100: The query divides the number of distinct 'case_id' values that pass the filter by the total number of distinct 'case_id' values in the table, and multiplies the result by 100. This gives the percentage of updated events.\n\nBy describing each step of the query in this way, the signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of what the query is doing, making it easier for users to understand the SIGNAL language and how it is being used in this particular query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name ILIKE '%Update%')))\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
