{"signal_description": "Counts the number of unique case IDs in the 'defaultview-383' table where the 'event_name' column contains a value that starts with 'Create Quotation Item%' and matches the 'created' value.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Counts the number of unique case IDs in the 'defaultview-383' table where the 'event_name' column contains a value that starts with 'Create Quotation Item%' and matches the 'created' value.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query uses the COUNT function to count the number of unique case IDs in the 'defaultview-383' table. The COUNT function is applied to the DISTINCT \"case_id\" column, which means that each case ID is counted only once, even if there are multiple rows with the same case ID.\n\nThe FILTER clause is used to filter the rows that are counted based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the BEHAVIOR function must match the 'created' value. The BEHAVIOR function is applied to the event_name column, and it checks if the value in that column starts with 'Create Quotation Item%'. If the value does not start with 'Create Quotation Item%', then the row is not counted.\n\nThe MATCHES function is used to match the 'created' value with the result of the BEHAVIOR function. If the 'created' value matches the result of the BEHAVIOR function, then the row is counted.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as counting the number of unique case IDs in the 'defaultview-383' table where the 'event_name' column contains a value that starts with 'Create Quotation Item%' and matches the 'created' value.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT (DISTINCT \"case_id\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE 'Create Quotation Item%'\n      ) AS created MATCHES (created)\n  )\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
