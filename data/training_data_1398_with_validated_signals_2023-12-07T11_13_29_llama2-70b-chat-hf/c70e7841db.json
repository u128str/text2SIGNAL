The first line SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT DeliveryId) specifies that we want to count the number of unique DeliveryId values in the table.\n2. The FILTER clause is used to filter the data to only include rows where a specific condition is met. In this case, the condition is that the BEHAVIOR (event_name = 'Create Outbound Delivery') AS created MATCHES (created) must be true. This means that only rows where the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event has occurred will be included in the count.\n3. The FROM clause specifies the table to use for the query, which is FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\").\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should summarize the query as \"Count the number of unique DeliveryId in the 'defaultview-383' table, where the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event has occurred.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT DeliveryId) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name = 'Create Outbound Delivery'\n      ) AS created MATCHES (created)\n  )\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
