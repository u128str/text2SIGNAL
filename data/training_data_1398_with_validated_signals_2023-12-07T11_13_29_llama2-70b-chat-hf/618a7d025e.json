Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* The column names: \"case_id\", \"end_time\", \"event_name\"\n\t* The filter condition: \"event_name = 'Create Issue'\"\n\t* The aggregation function: \"count(case_id)\"\n\t* The date part function: \"DATE_PART('hour', ...)\"\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller, more manageable parts:\n\t* The first part of the query: \"SELECT count(case_id) as '# of Tickets'\"\n\t* The second part of the query: \"DATE_PART('hour',(SELECT FIRST('end_time') FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Issue'))) AS 'Ticket Creation Hour'\"\n3. Creating a human-readable description for each part of the query:\n\t* Part 1: \"Retrieve the count of tickets\"\n\t* Part 2: \"Retrieve the hour of the first 'end_time' for each ticket\"\n4. Combining the descriptions for each part of the query into a single, coherent sentence:\n\t* \"Retrieve the number of tickets created per hour.
