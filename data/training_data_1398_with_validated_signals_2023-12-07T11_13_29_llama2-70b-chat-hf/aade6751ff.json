The events are 'Clear Invoice' and 'Post Invoice'. The query first filters the events by their names and then calculates the time difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Post Invoice' event for each process instance.\n\nThe query uses the following tables and columns:\n\n* \"defaultview-133\" (table name)\n\t+ EVENT_NAME (column name)\n\t+ END_TIME (column name)\n\nThe query first filters the events by their names using the IN operator. It then uses the LAST and FIRST aggregate functions to get the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Post Invoice' event for each process instance. The time difference between these two events is calculated by subtracting the start time of the first 'Post Invoice' event from the end time of the last 'Clear Invoice' event. Finally, the query uses the AVG aggregate function to calculate the average time difference for all process instances in the 'defaultview-133' table.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query in a human-readable format, explaining the purpose of the query and the tables and columns used.
