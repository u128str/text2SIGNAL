{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " signal_description\": \"Retrieve total open and overdue receivables, average net payment terms, and various customer information for accounts receivable created on or after January 1, 2022, with filtering and sorting applied.\"\n\nThis Signal query summarizes the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query. The description is constructed in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, column schema, and respective values.\n\nThe query starts by selecting various columns from the \"FLATTEN\" table named \"defaultview-222\" and filtering the results to only include records where the \"ClearingDate\" is null, \"NetDueDate\" is not null, \"AR_Customer\" is not null, and the \"EVENT_NAME\" is equal to 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\nThe selected columns include \"AR_CompanyCode\", \"AR_Customer\", \"AR_CustomerName\", \"AR_TradingPartner\", \"AR_CustomerCountry\", \"AR_IsOneTimeCustomerAccount\", \"AR_CustomerAccountingClerk\", \"AR_CustomerCreditMemoPaymentTerms\", \"AR_CustomerLastDunningDate\", \"AR_CustomerPaymentBlockingReason\", \"AR_CustomerPaymentTerms\", \"AR_CustomerDunningBlock\", and \"AR_CustomerDunningLevel\".\n\nThe query then calculates and filters the results further by adding a few calculated fields:\n\n* \"# Total Open Receivables\" is the count of distinct \"ARUniqueKey\" where the \"EVENT_NAME\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the \"ClearingDate\" is null.\n* \"Open Amount USD\" is the sum of \"AmountInGlobalCurrency\" where the \"EVENT_NAME\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the \"ClearingDate\" is null.\n* \"# Total Overdue Receivables\" is the count of distinct \"ARUniqueKey\" where the \"EVENT_NAME\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the \"ClearingDate\" is null and the current date is greater than or equal to the \"NetDueDate\".\n* \"Open Overdue Amount USD\" is the sum of \"AmountInGlobalCurrency\" where the \"EVENT_NAME\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the \"ClearingDate\" is null and the current date is greater than or equal to the \"NetDueDate\".\n* \"AVG Net Payment Terms\" is the average of the difference between \"NetDueDate\" and \"DocumentDate\" for records where the \"EVENT_NAME\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\nFinally, the results are sorted in descending order by the seventh column (which contains the \"Open Amount USD\") and the output is a JSON object with a single key-value pair, where the key is \"signal_description\" and the value is a human-readable description of the Signal query.", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
