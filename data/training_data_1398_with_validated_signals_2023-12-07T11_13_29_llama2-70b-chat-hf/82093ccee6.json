It selects the sum of the 'TSR_Count' column from the 'defaultview-197' table.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identified the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-197\"\n* The column name: \"TSR_Count\"\n* The aggregation function: SUM\n\nWe then constructed a human-readable description of the query by combining these components. We started with the phrase \"Retrieve the sum of the\" and then mentioned the column name, followed by the table name.\n\nFor example, if the table name was \"orders\" and the column name was \"total_amount\", the signal_description would be \"Retrieve the sum of the total_amount column in the orders table.\"\n\nIn this case, the table name is \"defaultview-197\" and the column name is \"TSR_Count\", so the signal_description is \"Retrieve the sum of the TSR_Count column in the defaultview-197 table.\"\n\nIt's important to note that the signal_description is not a literal translation of the SIGNAL query, but rather a human-readable summary that helps users understand what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\"TSR_Count\")\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
