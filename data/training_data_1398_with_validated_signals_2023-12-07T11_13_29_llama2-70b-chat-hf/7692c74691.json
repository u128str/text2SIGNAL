In this case, we are selecting a count of distinct values.\n* `count(DISTINCT \"PO ID\")`: This is the aggregation function used to count the number of distinct values in the \"PO ID\" column. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each value is only counted once, even if there are duplicate values in the column.\n* `FROM \"defaultview-124\"`: This is the table reference clause, which specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, we are retrieving data from a table named \"defaultview-124\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the main aspects of the query, which are:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n* The column name: \"PO ID\"\n* The aggregation function: count(DISTINCT)\n* The purpose of the query: retrieving the count of distinct \"PO ID\" values.\n\nThe signal_description should be concise and easy to understand, so it can be used as a summary of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT \"PO ID\") \nFROM \"defaultview-124\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
