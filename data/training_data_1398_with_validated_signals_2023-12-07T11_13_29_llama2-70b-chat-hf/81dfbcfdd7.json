The query filters the data to only include process instances where the event name matches 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n\nThe query then uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the timestamps of the last 'Clear Invoice' and first 'Post Invoice' events, respectively. The timestamps are then subtracted to calculate the time difference between the two events.\n\nFinally, the query uses the AVG function to calculate the average time difference across all process instances in the table.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation performed and referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  )\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE\n  EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
