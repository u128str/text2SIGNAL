The description is constructed by extracting the relevant information from the query and presenting it in a concise and readable format.\n\nThe description starts by listing the selected columns, followed by a brief description of the tables and subqueries used in the query. It then outlines the filtering conditions applied to the data, including the threshold values used for PO Count, PO Value (INR), and Total Purchase Amount (INR).
