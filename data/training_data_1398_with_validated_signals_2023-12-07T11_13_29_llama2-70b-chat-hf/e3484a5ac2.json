The first line of the query selects the first column, which is the month when the reviewer was added. This is calculated using the DATE_TRUNC function, with the first end_time value selected from the table where the event_name is 'Assign Reviewer'.\n2. The second line calculates the average duration between two event statuses: 'Change Status to In Review' and 'Change Status to Closed'. This is done by subtracting the first end_time value for 'Change Status to In Review' from the first end_time value for 'Change Status to Closed'. The resulting value is then wrapped in an AVG aggregation function.\n3. The FROM clause specifies the table to use for the query, which is \"defaultview-217\".\n4. The WHERE clause filters the data to only include events that match the specified pattern, which is 'Change Status to In Review' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'. The MATCHES function is used to perform a regular expression match.\n5. The GROUP BY clause groups the data by the first column (month).\n6. The ORDER BY clause sorts the data by the first column in ascending order.\n\nBased on these components, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the query's purpose and the data it operates on.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Assign Reviewer')) AS \"Month when Reviewer added\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed')\n        )\n      \t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n      \t   WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review'))\n    ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review' ~> ('Change Status to Closed'))\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
