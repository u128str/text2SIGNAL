The query is designed to calculate the average time difference between two specific events in a process instance.\n\nThe query starts by selecting the AVG (average) of a subquery that calculates the time difference between the last 'Receive Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance. The subquery uses the FILTER clause to filter the events based on their names, and the LAST and FIRST functions to select the last and first events, respectively.\n\nThe main query then filters the process instances to only those that have both 'Create PO Item' and 'Receive Invoice' events, using the MATCHES clause. Finally, the query selects the signal description from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n\nThe signal description is a human-readable summary of the query, which describes the calculation being performed and the tables and columns involved. It is constructed by concatenating the table name, column names, and respective values, along with descriptive text to explain the calculation. In this case, the signal description indicates that the query is calculating the average time difference between the last 'Receive Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance in the 'defaultview-545' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))\n        \nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item'  'Receive Invoice')\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
