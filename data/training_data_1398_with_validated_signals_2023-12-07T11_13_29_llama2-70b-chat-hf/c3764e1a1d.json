In this case, we are interested in calculating the average time difference between two events.\n* The next part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be used for the query. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-431\".\n* The WHERE clause is used to filter the data to only include process instances that have certain events. In this case, we are interested in process instances that have both 'Create PO Item' and 'Create PR Item' events.\n* The GROUP BY clause is used to group the data by process instance, so that we can calculate the time difference for each process instance separately.\n* The AVG function is used to calculate the average time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event for each process instance.\n* The LAST and FIRST functions are used to retrieve the timestamps of the last 'Create PO Item' and first 'Create PR Item' events, respectively.\n* The IN operator is used to check if the event name is in the list of specified values.\n* The JSON output is constructed by enclosing the signal_description text in curly braces and using double quotes to enclose the table and column names.\n\nThe signal_description text is constructed by describing the calculation performed by the SIGNAL query in a natural language style. It includes references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PR Item'))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
