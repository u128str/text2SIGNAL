This part is described in the signal_description as \"Retrieve the number of process orders created\".\n* The second part of the query is \"(COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE 'Event Created By User Type' NOT IN ('Dialog'))) / (COUNT (EVENT_NAME)) * 100 AS 'Automation Rate'\", which is calculating the automation rate by dividing the count of the 'event_name' column that have a 'Event Created By User Type' other than 'Dialog' by the total count of the 'event_name' column, then multiplying by 100. This part is described in the signal_description as \"The automation rate is calculated by dividing the number of process orders created by a user type other than 'Dialog' by the total number of process orders created, then multiplying by 100\".\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM FLATTEN('defaultview-183')\", which is specifying the table to query. This part is described in the signal_description as \"The results are retrieved from the 'defaultview-183' table\".\n* The fourth part of the query is \"WHERE 'Planned Order Number' IS NULL AND EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order'\", which is specifying the filter conditions for the query. This part is described in the signal_description as \"The results are filtered to only include rows where the 'Planned Order Number' is null and the 'Event Name' is 'Create Process Order'\".\n* The fifth part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1 desc LIMIT 10\", which is sorting the results in descending order by the first column and limiting the results to the top 10 rows. This part is described in the signal_description as \"The results are sorted in descending order by the number of process orders created and limited to the top 10 rows\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, describing each part of the query and its purpose in a concise and clear manner.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(event_name) AS \"# Created Process Orders\" ,\n(COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog'))) / (COUNT (EVENT_NAME)) * 100 AS \"Automation Rate\", \n \"Plant\" \nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL AND EVENT_NAME = 'Create Process Order'\n-- AND count(event_name) > 5000\nORDER BY 1 desc\nLIMIT 10 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
