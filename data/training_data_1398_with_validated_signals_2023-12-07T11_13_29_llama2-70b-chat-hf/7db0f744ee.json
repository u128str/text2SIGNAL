Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-290\"\n2. Understanding the query structure:\n\t* SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ AVG (expression) AS \"Lead time: sales document item creation to delivery creation\"\n\t* FROM clause:\n\t\t+ \"defaultview-290\"\n3. Analyzing the expression:\n\t* First, we identify the subqueries:\n\t\t- SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Outbound Delivery') AND((NOW() - LAST (END_TIME)) < DURATION '3000days')\n\t\t- SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Sales Order Item')\n\t* Then, we extract the column names and respective values used in the subqueries:\n\t\t- LAST (END_TIME)\n\t\t- EVENT_NAME\n\t\t- NOW()\n\t\t- LAST (END_TIME)\n\t\t- FIRST (END_TIME)\n\t\t- EVENT_NAME\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* We start by describing the calculation's purpose: \"Calculate the average lead time between the creation of a sales document item and the creation of a delivery.\"\n\t* Then, we explain the calculation method: \"The calculation is based on the last occurrence of the event 'Create Outbound Delivery' with a duration of 3000 days and the first occurrence of the event 'Create Sales Order Item'.\"\n\t* Finally, we reference the table name and column names: \"The calculation is based on the last occurrence of the event 'Create Outbound Delivery' with a duration of 3000 days and the first occurrence of the event 'Create Sales Order Item' in the 'defaultview-290' table.\"\n\nNote: The above signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.
