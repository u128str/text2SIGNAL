In this case, we want to include the count of case_ids that meet certain criteria.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a case_id to be included in the output. In this case, we want to filter out case_ids that do not have at least one event with the name 'Change Status to To Do'.\n* Then, we have the first subquery, which calculates the number of events with the name 'Change Status to To Do' for each case_id. This subquery uses the FIRST function to select the earliest end time for each case_id.\n* The second subquery calculates the number of events with the name 'Create Issue' for each case_id. This subquery also uses the FIRST function to select the earliest end time for each case_id.\n* The third subquery calculates the difference between the two previous subqueries, which gives us the number of days between the first 'Create Issue' event and the first 'Change Status to To Do' event.\n* The fourth subquery filters out case_ids where the difference calculated in the previous subquery is greater than 2 days.\n* Finally, we have the division and multiplication operations, which give us the percentage of case_ids that meet the criteria.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing and how it is arriving at its results.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \ncount(case_id) FILTER(WHERE\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))\n\t< DURATION '2days') \n/ \ncount(case_id) FILTER(WHERE (SELECT count(event_name) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to To Do') >0)\n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
