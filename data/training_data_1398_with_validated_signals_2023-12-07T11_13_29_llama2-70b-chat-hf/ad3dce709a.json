The query is using the 'defaultview-59' table.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identified the main components of the query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-59\"\n* The column name: event_name\n* The filter condition: event_name IN ('Update Payment Term')\n* The aggregation function: AVG\n* The subquery: SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Update Payment Term'))\n\nWe then constructed the signal_description by describing each component in a human-readable format, using phrases such as \"Calculate the average number of\" and \"in the 'defaultview-59' table.\" We also explicitly referenced the column name and filter condition in the description.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what it is trying to achieve.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Update Payment Term'))))\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
