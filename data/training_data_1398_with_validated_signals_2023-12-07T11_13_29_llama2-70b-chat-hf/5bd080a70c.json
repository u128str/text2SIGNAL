Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID), COUNT(DISTINCT IF(CHANGES = 1, CASE_ID, NULL)), and \"PO Material Group\"\n\t* The FROM clause: a subquery that selects CASE_ID, EVENT_NAME, and \"PO Item Material Group Text\" from FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\n\t* The WHERE clause: \"PO Item Material Group Text\" IS NOT NULL\n\t* The ORDER BY clause: 1 DESC\n\t* The LIMIT clause: 20\n2. Breaking down the subquery:\n\t* The subquery is a SELECT statement that retrieves CASE_ID, EVENT_NAME, and \"PO Item Material Group Text\" from FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\n\t* The FLATTEN function flattens the data in the \"defaultview-124\" table into a simpler format\n\t* The WHERE clause filters the data to only include rows where \"PO Item Material Group Text\" is not null\n3. Understanding the logic of the query:\n\t* The query first filters the data to only include rows where \"PO Item Material Group Text\" is not null\n\t* It then calculates the total number of cases (COUNT(DISTINCT CASE_ID)) and the total number of cases with changes (COUNT(DISTINCT IF(CHANGES = 1, CASE_ID, NULL)))\n\t* The CHANGES field is created by checking if the EVENT_NAME is in a specific list of update events. If it is, then the value of CHANGES is 1, otherwise it is null.\n\t* The \"PO Material Group\" field is extracted from the \"PO Item Material Group Text\" field.\n4. Summarizing the query in human-readable form:\n\t* The query retrieves the total number of cases, cases with changes, and the PO material group.\n\t* Cases with changes are identified by the presence of an update event for specific fields such as contract net price, target quantity, order confirmation, etc.\n\t* The PO material group is extracted from the PO item material group text.\n\nThe signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components and logic of the query.
