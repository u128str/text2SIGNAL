Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT(DISTINCT \"case_id\")\n\t* FILTER clause: WHERE BEHAVIOR (event_name LIKE 'Create Sales Order Item%') MATCHES (created)\n\t* FROM clause: FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\n2. Breaking down the FILTER clause into its components:\n\t* BEHAVIOR clause: event_name LIKE 'Create Sales Order Item%'\n\t* MATCHES clause: created\n3. Identifying the table and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table: \"defaultview-383\"\n\t* Columns: \"case_id\", \"event_name\", \"created\"\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query, using the identified components and table/column names:\n\t* \"Counts the number of unique 'case_id' values in the 'defaultview-383' table, where the 'event_name' column contains a value that starts with 'Create Sales Order Item%' and matches the 'created' value in the same row.\"\n\nThe description highlights the main aspects of the query:\n\n* The query selects a specific column (\"case_id\") and applies a filter to it.\n* The filter is based on the values in the \"event_name\" and \"created\" columns.\n* The query uses the BEHAVIOR function to check if the \"event_name\" value starts with 'Create Sales Order Item%'.\n* The query uses the MATCHES function to check if the \"created\" value in the same row matches the value in the \"created\" column.\n* The query applies a FILTER clause to only consider rows where the above conditions are met.\n* The query uses the COUNT(DISTINCT) function to count the number of unique \"case_id\" values that pass the filter.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT (DISTINCT \"case_id\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE 'Create Sales Order Item%'\n      ) AS created MATCHES (created)\n  )\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
