Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: AVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice') - (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Goods Receipt'))\n\t* The FROM clause: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its subqueries:\n\t* The first subquery: SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice'\n\t* The second subquery: SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Goods Receipt'\n3. Identifying the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n\t* Column names: EVENT_NAME, END_TIME\n4. Understanding the logic of the query:\n\t* The query calculates the average cycle time for creating a FI invoice and creating a goods receipt.\n\t* The cycle time is calculated by taking the difference between the last end time of the 'Create FI Invoice' event and the last end time of the 'Create Goods Receipt' event.\n\t* The result is then averaged and displayed as 'Avg. Cycle Time'.\n5. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Using the information gathered in steps 1-4, a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query was constructed. The description includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query, as well as a brief explanation of the logic behind the query.\n\nThe resulting signal_description is a concise and informative summary of the SIGNAL query, providing a clear understanding of what the query does and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG((SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice')\n- (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Goods Receipt'))\nAS \"Avg.
