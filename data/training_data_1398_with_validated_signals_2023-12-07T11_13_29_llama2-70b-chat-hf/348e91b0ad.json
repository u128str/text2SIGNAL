The FILTER clause is used to filter the results to only include rows where the 'Resolution' column is not null.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identify the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-370\"\n* The column names: \"case_id\", \"Resolution\"\n* The filter condition: \"Resolution\" IS NOT NULL\n\nWe then construct the signal_description by describing each component in a human-readable format, using phrases that explain the purpose of each component. The resulting signal_description is a concise summary of the SIGNAL query that is easy to understand for a human reader.\n\nHere's a breakdown of how we constructed the signal_description:\n\n* \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'case_id' values\" - This phrase explains the main purpose of the query, which is to retrieve a count of distinct values for a specific column.\n* \"from the 'defaultview-370' table\" - This phrase identifies the table name and provides context for the query.\n* \"where the 'Resolution' column is not null\" - This phrase explains the filter condition used in the query, which is to only include rows where the 'Resolution' column has a value.\n\nBy combining these phrases, we get a clear and concise signal_description that summarizes the main components of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\ncount(\"case_id\") FILTER ( WHERE \"Resolution\" IS NOT NULL)\nFROM \"defaultview-370\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
