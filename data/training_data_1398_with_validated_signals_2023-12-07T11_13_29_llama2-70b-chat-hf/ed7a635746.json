{"signal_description": "Calculate the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed to calculate the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\n\n1. The first part of the query uses a subquery to calculate the count of event names:\n\nCOUNT(event_name)\n\nThis subquery retrieves the count of all event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\n\n2. The second part of the query uses another subquery to calculate the count of distinct event names:\n\nCOUNT(DISTINCT event_name)\n\nThis subquery retrieves the count of unique event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\n\n3. The main query then calculates the difference between the total count of event names and the count of distinct event names:\n\nSUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name)))\n\nThis calculates the difference between the total number of event names and the number of unique event names.\n\n4. Finally, the query calculates the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names:\n\nSUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))) * 100\n\nThis calculates the percentage of unique event names by dividing the difference between the total count and distinct count by the total count, and then multiplying by 100.\n\nThe resulting value is a percentage that represents the proportion of unique event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should read: \"Calculate the percentage of unique event names from the total number of event names in the 'defaultview-95' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\n(SELECT COUNT(event_name) - COUNT(DISTINCT event_name))\n)\n/\nSUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name))) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-95\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
