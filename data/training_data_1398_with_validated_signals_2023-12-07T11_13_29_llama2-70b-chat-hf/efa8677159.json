In this case, we want to count the number of events that match certain criteria.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for an event to be included in the count. In this case, we are filtering out events where the Event Created By User Type is in (\\'Dialog\\').\n* Then, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table or view that we want to query. In this case, we are querying a flattened view called FLATTEN(\\\"defaultview-183\\\").\n* Finally, we have the WHERE clause, which specifies any additional conditions that must be met for an event to be included in the count. In this case, we are only counting events where the event_name is equal to \\'Confirmed\\'.\n\nTo summarize the query, we are counting the number of events that meet certain criteria, filtering out events created by a specific user type, and dividing the result by the total count of events with a specific name.
