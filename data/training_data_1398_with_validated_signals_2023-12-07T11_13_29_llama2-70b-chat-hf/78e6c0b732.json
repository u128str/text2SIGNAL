This tells us that the query is operating on a table named \"defaultview-545\".\n* Next, we have the column names and their respective values that are used in the query:\n\t+ \"Invoice ID\": This column contains unique identifiers for each invoice.\n\t+ \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\": This column contains the current status of the invoice reconciliation process.\n\t+ \"Last Invoice Submission Method\": This column contains the method used to submit the invoice.\n* Then, we have the filter clauses:\n\t+ FILTER (WHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling' AND \"Last Invoice Submission Method\"= 'PaperInvoice')\n\t+ FILTER (WHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling')\nThese clauses filter the data to only include invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling' and a last invoice submission method of 'PaperInvoice', and then to only include invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling'.\n* Finally, we have the calculation: COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") / COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") * 100. This calculates the percentage of invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling' and a last invoice submission method of 'PaperInvoice' out of all invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling'.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Get the number of distinct invoice IDs for invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling' and a last invoice submission method of 'PaperInvoice', and then divide that number by the total number of distinct invoice IDs for all invoices with a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling', multiplied by 100.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling' \n    AND \"Last Invoice Submission Method\"= 'PaperInvoice'\n\t)\n/\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling'\n\t)     \n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
