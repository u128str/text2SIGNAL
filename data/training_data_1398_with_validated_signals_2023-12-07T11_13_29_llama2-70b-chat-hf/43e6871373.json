First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-124.\"\n2. Next, we determined the columns used in the query. In this case, only one column is used: \"EVENT_NAME.\"\n3. We noted that the query uses the \"FLATTEN\" function to flatten the data from the table into a flat format.\n4. We observed that the query uses the \"ORDER BY\" clause to sort the results in descending order based on the \"1\" column, which corresponds to the \"EVENT_NAME\" column.\n5. Finally, we constructed the signal_description by combining the information gathered in steps 1-4, using a human-readable format that includes the table name, column names, and respective values.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what data it will return.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDISTINCT\nEVENT_NAME\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\nORDER BY 1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
