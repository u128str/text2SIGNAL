The query is filtering the data from the \"defaultview-404\" table based on two conditions:\n\n1. The event_name is in ('Review Marketing Forecast') and the end_time is not null. This condition is applied using the FILTER function.\n2. The Marketing Forecast Qty is not zero. This condition is also applied using the FILTER function.\n\nThe query then calculates the count of case_id that meet both conditions and divides it by the total count of case_id. The result is expressed as a percentage.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the data from \"defaultview-404\" table based on the two conditions mentioned above.\n2. Calculate the count of case_id that meet both conditions.\n3. Divide the count by the total count of case_id.\n4. Express the result as a percentage.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(\"end_time\")\n\t\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Review Marketing Forecast') \n\t\t)IS NOT NULL\n\t)\n)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"Marketing Forecast Qty\" <> 0\n) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
