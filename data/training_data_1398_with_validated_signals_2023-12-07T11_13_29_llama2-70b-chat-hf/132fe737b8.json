The query selects the average of the time differences between two events, 'Receive Invoice' and 'Receive PO Item', for each process instance in the 'defaultview-431' table.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. The first part of the query uses the SELECT clause to retrieve the last 'Receive Invoice' event for each process instance. This is done using the LAST function, which returns the last value of a specified column. In this case, the column is 'END_TIME', and the filter clause is used to only consider rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' column contains the value 'Receive Invoice'.\n2. The second part of the query uses the SELECT clause to retrieve the first 'Receive PO Item' event for each process instance. This is done using the FIRST function, which returns the first value of a specified column. In this case, the column is again 'END_TIME', and the filter clause is used to only consider rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' column contains the value 'Receive PO Item'.\n3. The two event times are then subtracted from each other to calculate the time difference between the two events.\n4. The resulting time differences are then averaged using the AVG function.\n5. Finally, the query uses the FROM clause to specify the table to query, which is \"defaultview-431\".\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation performed and the table and column names used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive PO Item')))) \n        \nFROM \"defaultview-431\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
