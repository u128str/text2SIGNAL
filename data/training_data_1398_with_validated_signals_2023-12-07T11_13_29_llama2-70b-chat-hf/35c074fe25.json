Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"# Process Orders\": This portion of the query calculates the number of process orders for each row in the table. The alias \"# Process Orders\" is used to give a descriptive name to the calculated column.\n\t* \", \"Division\": This portion of the query selects the \"Division\" column from the table.\n3. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-183\"\n\t* Column names: \"CASE_ID\", \"Actual Finish Date\", \"Deletion Flag\", \"Division\"\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a descriptive phrase, such as \"Retrieve the number of process orders for each division\"\n\t* Explain the conditions specified in the WHERE clause, such as \"where the actual finish date is not null and deletion flag is null\"\n\t* Mention the grouping and ordering criteria, such as \"group by division, and order by number of process orders in descending order\"\n\t* Use proper nouns and phrases to make the description more readable, such as \"process orders\" instead of \"CASE_ID\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and criteria of the query without having to read the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"# Process Orders\", \"Division\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Actual Finish Date\" IS NOT NULL AND \"Deletion Flag\" IS NULL\nGROUP BY 2\nORDER BY 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
