The \"DISTINCT\" keyword is used to retrieve unique event names.\n\nThe query then uses the \"FROM\" clause to specify the table name, which is \"FLATTEN('defaultview-225')\". This table name is referenced in the signal_description as \"defaultview-225\".\n\nFinally, the query uses the \"ORDER BY\" clause to sort the results by the \"event_name\" column in ascending order, which is reflected in the signal_description as \"ordered by event name in ascending order\".\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining the information about the table name, column names, and aggregation functions used in the SIGNAL query. It provides a concise and human-readable summary of the query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and results of the query without having to examine the actual query text.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DISTINCT event_name AS \"Event Name:\", COUNT(case_id)\nFROM FLATTEN (\"defaultview-225\")\nORDER BY 1 ASC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
