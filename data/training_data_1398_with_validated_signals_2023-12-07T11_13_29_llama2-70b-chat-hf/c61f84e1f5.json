The first line of the query selects the month in which the Reviewer was added, using the DATE_TRUNC function and the FIRST function to retrieve the first end_time value for events with the name 'Assign Validator'.\n2. The second line calculates the duration between the 'Assign Validator' and 'Change Status to Ready For Review' events, using the AVG function and subtracting the first end_time value for 'Change Status to Ready For Review' events from the first end_time value for 'Assign Validator' events.\n3. The FROM clause specifies the table to use, which is \"defaultview-217\".\n4. The WHERE clause filters the events to only those that have a name matching either 'Assign Validator' or 'Change Validator', and that have a status of 'Ready For Review'.\n5. The GROUP BY clause groups the events by month, using the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the end_time values to the first day of the month.\n6. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by month.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the query's purpose and the data it retrieves.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Assign Validator')) AS \"Month when Reviewer added\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name IN ('Assign Validator')\n        )\n      \t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n      \t   WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready For Review'))\n    ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to Ready For Review' ~> ('Assign Validator'|'Change Validator'))\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
