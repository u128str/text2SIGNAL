These conditions tell us that we are only interested in rows where the \"event_name\" is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the \"ClearingDate\" is null.\n\nPutting all of this information together, we get the signal_description: \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'ARUniqueKey' values from the 'defaultview-197' table where the 'event_name' is 'Create Accounts Receivable' and the 'ClearingDate' is null.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\nWHERE\nevent_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\nAND ClearingDate  IS NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
