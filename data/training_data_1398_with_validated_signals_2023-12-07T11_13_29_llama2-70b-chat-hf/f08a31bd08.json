The Filter function is used to filter the events based on their names. The subtraction operation is used to calculate the time difference between the events.\n\nThe signal_description explains the query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name (\"defaultview-225\"), column names (event_name, end_time), and respective values (e.g., 'Vendor Creates Invoice', 'Create Goods Receipt'). It also highlights the calculations performed (e.g., average time between events) and the events involved in each calculation.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Vendor Creates Invoice')))) AS \"Vendor Creates Invoice => Create Goods Receipt\",\n\n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Post Invoice')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt')))) AS \"Create Goods Receipt => Post Invoice\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Post Invoice')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Vendor Creates Invoice')))) AS \"Vendor Creates Invoice => Post Invoice\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Due Date passed')))\n    - (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Post Invoice')))) AS \"Post Invoice => Post Invoice\"\n\nFROM \"defaultview-225\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
