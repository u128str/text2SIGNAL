The events should have names starting with 'GI' or 'GR'.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n1. The first part of the query is a SELECT clause, which retrieves the count of events with a specific name.\n2. The FILTER clause is used to filter out events created by users with a specific type.\n3. The second part of the query is another SELECT clause, which retrieves the count of all events.\n4. The two counts are then divided to calculate the percentage of events created by users other than 'Dialog'.\n5. The query uses the FLATTEN function to flatten the data from the \"defaultview-183\" table.\n6. Finally, the query uses the WHERE clause to filter out events that do not have names starting with 'GI' or 'GR'.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query. It includes references to the table name (\"defaultview-183\"), column names (\"event_name\"), and respective values (e.g. 'GI', 'GR'). The description also highlights the main purpose of the query, which is to calculate the percentage of events created by users other than 'Dialog'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (count(event_name) \nFILTER(WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog')))\n/\n(count(event_name)\n)\n*100\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\nWHERE event_name LIKE 'GI%' OR event_name LIKE 'GR%'\n\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
