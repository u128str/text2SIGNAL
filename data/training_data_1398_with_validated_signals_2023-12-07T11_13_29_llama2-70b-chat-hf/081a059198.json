This is done using a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include cases where the actual delivery date is later than the scheduled finish date.\n* The \"release\" column is calculated using a CASE statement that checks whether the actual release date is earlier than, later than, or equal to the scheduled release date. If the actual release date is earlier than the scheduled release date, then the release status is \"Early\". If the actual release date is later than the scheduled release date, then the release status is \"Late\". Otherwise, the release status is \"on-time\".\n* The query then filters the results to only include cases where the actual finish date and scheduled finish date are not null, and the actual start date and scheduled start date are not null.\n* Finally, the query retrieves the results from the \"defaultview-183\" table.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (count(case_id)\nFILTER (\nWHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds')\n /\n count(case_id)) \n *100 as \"Late delivery rate\",\nCase\nWhen \"Actual Release Date\" - \"Scheduled Release Date\" < DURATION '0seconds'\n THEN 'Early'\nWhen \"Actual Release Date\" - \"Scheduled Release Date\" > DURATION '0seconds'\nThen 'Late'\nElse 'on-time'\nEnd as \"release\"\n\n\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWhere \"Actual Finish Date\" is not null\nAND \"Scheduled Finish Date\" is not null\nAND \"Actual Start Date\" is not null\nAND \"Scheduled Start Date\" is not null\n\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
