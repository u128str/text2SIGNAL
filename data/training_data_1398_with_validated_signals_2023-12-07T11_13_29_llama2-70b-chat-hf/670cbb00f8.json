The query uses a subquery to filter cases with invoice clearings and calculates the above metrics using aggregations and filters on the 'defaultview-529' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Signal query starts by selecting various columns from a subquery that filters cases with invoice clearings. The subquery uses the 'defaultview-529' table and applies filters to select only cases with a clear invoice.\n\nThe main query then applies aggregations and calculations to the filtered data to extract the desired metrics. The metrics include:\n\n* Company code name\n* Invoice amount\n* Number of invoices\n* Late payment rate\n* Dunning block rate\n* Days posting to net due date\n* Automatic invoice posting percentage\n* Rework rate\n* Change rate\n* Dunning block duration\n* Total cycle time\n\nThe query uses various techniques to calculate these metrics, such as filtering, aggregations, and calculations using the 'CASE' statement. The 'CASE' statement is used to calculate the late payment rate, dunning block rate, and change rate.\n\nThe query also uses subqueries to calculate the dunning block duration and total cycle time. The subqueries use the 'LAST' and 'FIRST' functions to extract the last and first event times for the 'Remove Dunning Block' and 'Post Invoice' events, respectively.\n\nFinally, the query groups the data by the company code text and orders it by the invoice amount in descending order.\n\nThe signal_description provides a summary of the query, describing the main metrics extracted and the table used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Inv.
