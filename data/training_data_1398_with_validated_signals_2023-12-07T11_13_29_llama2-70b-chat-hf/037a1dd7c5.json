This is done using the COUNT() function and the FILTER() function to filter the results based on the specified condition.\n* The second part of the query is another subquery that selects the count of all events. This is done using the COUNT() function without any filters.\n* The third part of the query calculates the percentage of events created by System or Service users by dividing the result of the first subquery by the result of the second subquery and then multiplying the result by 100. This is done using the SUM() function to calculate the total number of events and the / operator to divide the two counts. The * 100 operator is used to convert the result to a percentage.\n* The final part of the query selects the result of the calculation and assigns it to a variable named \"signal_description\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description can be summarized as \"Calculate the percentage of events created by System or Service users out of all events.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))\n\t)\n   )\n/ SUM((SELECT COUNT(event_name)))\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
