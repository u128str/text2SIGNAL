Item Vendor Master CD 1/2/NDD\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-225\"\n2. Identifying the column names and their respective values used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" and \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1\" and \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" and \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\"\n3. Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses the FILTER function to filter the rows based on the conditions specified in the WHERE clause.\n\t* The conditions are:\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1\"\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\"\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" is less than \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\"\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* It also includes a brief description of the logic of the query, highlighting the conditions and filters applied.\n\nThe resulting signal_description is: \"Count of case_id where Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1/2/Net Payment Terms Period is less than Last Inv.
