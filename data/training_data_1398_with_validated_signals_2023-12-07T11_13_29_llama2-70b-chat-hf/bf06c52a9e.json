In this case, we have a single column called \"COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\")\" that is filtered by a WHERE clause.\n* The WHERE clause is filtered using the FILTER function, which takes a condition as its argument. In this case, the condition is \"BEHAVIOR (EventCreatedByUserType IN ('Dialog') AND (event_name LIKE '%Invoice%' AND ChangeType = 'Update')) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)\". This condition checks if the event was created by a user type of 'Dialog', and if the event name contains 'Invoice' and the ChangeType is 'Update'. If all these conditions are met, then the event is counted.\n* The COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") calculates the number of unique event IDs that match the conditions specified in the WHERE clause.\n* Finally, the result is divided by COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (WHERE (\"EventCreatedByUserType\" IS NOT NULL)), which calculates the percentage of events that match the conditions specified in the WHERE clause out of all events with non-null 'EventCreatedByUserType'.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by describing each part of the query in a human-readable way, using phrases such as \"Counts the number of unique event IDs\", \"for events created by user type 'Dialog'\", \"with name containing 'Invoice'\", \"and ChangeType = 'Update'\", \"and then calculates the percentage of such events out of all events with non-null 'EventCreatedByUserType'\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('Dialog')\n        AND (\n          event_name LIKE '%Invoice%'\n          AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n      ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n      (\"EventCreatedByUserType\" IS NOT NULL) ) * 100\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\nWHERE\n  (\n    event_name LIKE '%Invoice%'\n    AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n  ) \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
