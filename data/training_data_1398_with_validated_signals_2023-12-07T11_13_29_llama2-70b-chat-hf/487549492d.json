SELECT: The query starts by selecting two columns from the \"defaultview-59\" table: COUNT(case_id) and COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(event_name IN ('Update Payment Term'))))\n2. FILTER: The COUNT(case_id) column is filtered using a subquery that selects the BOOL_OR of the event_name column, which checks if the event name is in the list ('Update Payment Term'). This filter is applied to the case_id column.\n3. BOOL_OR: The subquery uses the BOOL_OR function to check if the event_name is in the list of strings.\n4. COUNT(case_id): The query then divides the filtered COUNT(case_id) by the total COUNT(case_id) to get a percentage.\n5. FROM: The query is applied to the \"defaultview-59\" table.\n\nThe signal_description explains the purpose of the query, describing what data is being selected, how it is being filtered, and what calculations are being performed.
