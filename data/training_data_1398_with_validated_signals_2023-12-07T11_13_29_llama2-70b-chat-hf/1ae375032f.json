It does this by subtracting the first 'Change Status to In Progress' event time from the last 'Change Status to Closed' event time.\n* The third part of the query filters the results to only include events that match the specified pattern, which is 'Change Status to In Progress' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'.\n* The final part of the query groups the results by month and orders them by the month.\n\nThe signal_description is a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, describing the main components of the query and their relationships.
