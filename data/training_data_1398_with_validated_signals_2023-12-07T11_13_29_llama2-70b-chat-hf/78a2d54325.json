The COUNT function is used to count the number of distinct case IDs (\"case_id\") in the table.\n\nThe FILTER clause is used to filter the data based on two conditions:\n\n1. \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" IS NOT NULL: This condition filters out any rows where the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" column is null.\n2. \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()): This condition filters out any rows where the \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" is greater than or equal to the current day.\n\nThe query is written in a human-readable format, with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values. The query is constructed in a way that it is easy to understand the logic and the intent behind the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(\"case_id\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\"Last Inv.
