In this case, we have a single column, which is the result of a calculation.\n* Next, we have the calculation itself, which is enclosed in parentheses. The calculation involves subtracting the average END_TIME of 'Start Management review' events from the average END_TIME of 'Complete Management review' events, both of which are filtered by the condition \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED'.\n* The result of the calculation is then multiplied by 10.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be used for the calculation.
