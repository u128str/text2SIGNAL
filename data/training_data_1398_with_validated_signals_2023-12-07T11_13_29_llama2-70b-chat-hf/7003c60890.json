This part specifies the table name from which the data should be retrieved.\n* The third part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1 DESC\". This part specifies that the results should be sorted in descending order based on the first column (which corresponds to the \"No. of Cases\" alias).\n* The fourth part of the query is \"LIMIT 50\".
