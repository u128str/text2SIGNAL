The events are 'Create Goods Receipt' and 'Create PO Item'. The query uses the LAST and FIRST aggregate functions to select the last 'Create Goods Receipt' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance. The time difference between these two events is calculated by subtracting the start time of the first 'Create PO Item' event from the end time of the last 'Create Goods Receipt' event. This time difference is then averaged across all process instances in the 'defaultview-57' table.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identify the key elements of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-57\"\n* Column names: event_name, end_time, start_time\n* Event names: 'Create Goods Receipt', 'Create PO Item'\n\nWe then construct a natural language description of the query, using phrases that describe the calculations performed in the query. The description includes the table name, column names, and event names, making it easy for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works. The resulting signal_description is in JSON format, as requested in the task.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n    (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt'))\n    -(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n   )\n\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
