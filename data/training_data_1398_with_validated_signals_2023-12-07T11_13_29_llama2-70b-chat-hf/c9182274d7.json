The query selects the average of a subtraction operation.\n2. The subtraction operation involves two selects, each selecting the first end_time for events with specific names.\n3. The first select retrieves the first end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to In Progress'.\n4. The second select retrieves the first end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to To Do'.\n5. The query filters the data to only include events where the event_name matches a specific pattern.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable instruction that summarizes the query's purpose.
