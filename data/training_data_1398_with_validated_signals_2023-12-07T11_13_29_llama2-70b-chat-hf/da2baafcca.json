{"signal_description": "Calculate the average of the difference between the count of events with name 'Change Status to In Progress' and 1, from the 'defaultview-217' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average of the difference between the count of events with name 'Change Status to In Progress' and 1, from the 'defaultview-217' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using a combination of SELECT, COUNT, and WHERE clauses. The query first selects the count of events with the name 'Change Status to In Progress' from the 'defaultview-217' table using the COUNT() function. This count is then subtracted from 1 using the minus (-) operator. Finally, the average of this difference is calculated using the AVG() function.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Select the count of events with the name 'Change Status to In Progress' from the 'defaultview-217' table.\n2. Subtract 1 from the count.\n3. Calculate the average of the resulting difference.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should read: \"Calculate the average of the difference between the count of events with name 'Change Status to In Progress' and 1, from the 'defaultview-217' table.\" This description explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG((\n\tSELECT count(event_name) \n    WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress'\n    )-1)\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
