In this case, we're selecting the average of a calculated value.\n* Next, we have a subquery that calculates the difference between two event times. The subquery uses the LAST() and FIRST() aggregation functions to get the last 'Clear Invoice' event time and the first 'Record Invoice Receipt' or 'Create FI Invoice' event time, respectively.\n* The subquery is then wrapped in another SELECT clause that chooses the average of the calculated difference.\n* Finally, we have a FROM clause that specifies the table to use for the query, which is \"defaultview-57\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Calculate the average time difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Record Invoice Receipt' or 'Create FI Invoice' event in the 'defaultview-57' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n    (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))\n    -(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Record Invoice Receipt','Create FI Invoice'))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
