It does this by subtracting the FIRST end_time value for 'Change Status to In Review' events from the LAST end_time value for 'Change Status to Closed' events, and then applying the AVG aggregation function.\n* The third part of the query filters the results to only include events that match the pattern 'Change Status to In Review' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'.\n* The final part of the query groups the results by the month column and orders them by the month column.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query in a human-readable format, highlighting the main components of the query, such as the table name, column names, and the operations performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed')) AS \"Month\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n\t\t WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed')\n      - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n      \t WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Review')\n       ) \nFILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Review' ~> \n    \t\t\t\t\t\t 'Change Status to Closed')\n\t\t) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
