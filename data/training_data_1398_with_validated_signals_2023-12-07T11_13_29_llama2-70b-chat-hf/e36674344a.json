The subquery filters the rows to only include those where the \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" is less than the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\", and then calculates the percentage of rows that have a non-null \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\".\n* The fourth part of the query filters the results to only include companies with non-null clearing dates.\n* The final part of the query orders the results by the \"Invoice Clearing Date\" column in ascending order, with null values placed first.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components and their relationships.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Invoice Clearing Date\",\n  \"Company Code Name\",\n  \"Payment Rate\"\nFROM\n  (\n    SELECT\n      DATE_TRUNC(\n        'Month',\n        (\n          SELECT\n            LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n              WHERE\n                EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\n            )\n        )\n      ) AS \"Invoice Clearing Date\",\n      \"Inv.
