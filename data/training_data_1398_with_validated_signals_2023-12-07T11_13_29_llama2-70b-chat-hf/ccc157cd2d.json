Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT(case_id)\n\t* FILTER clause: WHERE event_name MATCHES (...)\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-217\"\n2. Breaking down the FILTER clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* event_name MATCHES (('Change Status to Done' | 'Change Status to Closed') ~> ('Change Status to To Do'|'Change Status to In Progress'))\n\t* Using the NOT operator (~>) to negate the match, effectively searching for rows where the event_name changes from 'Done' or 'Closed' to 'To Do' or 'In Progress'\n3. Identifying the tables and columns used in the query:\n\t* defaultview-217 (table)\n\t* case_id (column)\n\t* event_name (column)\n4.
