SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, \"Month\" and \"Active Cases\".\n2. IF clause: The query uses an IF statement to check if the count of started cases is null, and if so, returns 0 instead.\n3. LAG clause: The query uses a LAG function to retrieve the count of finished cases for the previous month, and subtracts it from the count of started cases for the current month.\n4. SUM clause: The query uses a SUM function to calculate the count of started and finished cases for each month.\n5. FILTER clause: The query filters the data to only include rows where the started column is either 1 or 0.\n6. DATE_TRUNC clause: The query uses the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the date to the first day of the month.\n7. UNION ALL clause: The query combines the results of two SELECT statements using the UNION ALL operator.\n8. GROUP BY clause: The query groups the data by the month column.\n9. FILL TIMESERIES clause: The query fills in missing values in the time series data.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the selected columns, the conditions applied to the data, and the calculations performed. It also references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \"Month\"\n       ,IF(count_started IS NOT NULL, count_started, 0) - IF(LAG(count_finished) OVER () IS NOT NULL, LAG(count_finished) OVER (), 0) AS \"Active Cases\"\n  FROM (SELECT \"Month\"\n             , SUM(count_started) OVER (ORDER BY \"Month\") AS count_started\n             , SUM(count_finished) OVER (ORDER BY \"Month\") AS count_finished\n          FROM (SELECT \"Month\"\n                     , COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE started = 1) AS count_started\n                     , COUNT(1) FILTER (WHERE started = 0) AS count_finished\n                  FROM (SELECT date_trunc('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time))) AS \"Month\", \n                  \t\t\t   1 AS started\n                        FROM \"defaultview-9\"\n                        UNION ALL\n                        SELECT date_trunc('month', (SELECT LAST(end_time))) AS \"Month\", \n                               0 AS started\n                        FROM \"defaultview-9\") AS sub\n                 GROUP BY 1\n                 FILL TIMESERIES('month')\n               ) AS sub2\n       ) AS sub3 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
