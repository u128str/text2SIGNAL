The query selects the maximum average clearing time (`MAX(AVG_ClearingTime)`) from a temporary table (`AS temp`).\n2. The temporary table is created by selecting specific columns (`case_id`, `ClearingJournalEntry`, `BillingDocument`, `event_name`, and `end_time`) from the \"defaultview-197\" table.\n3. The `FIRST` function is applied to the `end_time` column, filtered by the `event_name` column, and partitioned by the `BillingDocument` column. This calculates the average clearing time for each billing document.\n4. The `CASE` statement is used to assign a new column name (`AVG_ClearingTime`) to the calculated average clearing time.\n5. The query filters the temporary table to only include rows where the `event_name` is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main elements of the query, such as the table name, column names, and the operations performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT MAX(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \nBillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Billing Document') OVER (PARTITION BY BillingDocument ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
