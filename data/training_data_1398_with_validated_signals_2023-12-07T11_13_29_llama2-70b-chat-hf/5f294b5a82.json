In this case, we have a single column, count(case_id), which counts the number of unique case_id values in the table.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which filters the rows to be processed by the query. In this case, we have two subqueries, each filtering a different set of rows based on the event_name and end_time columns. The first subquery selects the last end_time for each case_id where the event_name is 'Create Goods Receipt', while the second subquery selects the first end_time for each case_id where the event_name is 'Release PO'. The difference between these two times is calculated and compared to a duration of 14 days. If the difference is less than 14 days, the row is included in the filtered result.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be queried. In this case, we are querying a table named \"defaultview-124\".\n\nPutting it all together, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the key elements of the query and describing the logic behind it in a human-readable way.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\ncount(case_id)\n\tFILTER (WHERE \n\t\t\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Create Goods Receipt'))\n\t\t-\n\tFIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name\n\t\t\tIN ('Release PO'))\n\t\t) < DURATION '14days'\n)\n/count(case_id) *100\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
