Calculate the difference between the last end time of 'Approve Invoice' events and the first end time of 'Receive Invoice' events, then average the results. Group by PO Item Line Type.\"\n}\n\nThis signal_description was constructed by analyzing the given SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its key components.\n\n1. First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n2. Next, we looked at the SELECT clause, which includes three columns:\n\t* \"Quarter\"\n\t* \"Avg. Cycle Time (Receive Invoice to Approve Invoice)\"\n\t* \"PO Item Line Type\"\n3. We then examined the calculations for each column:\n\t* \"Quarter\" is obtained by truncating the last end time to the quarter level using DATE_TRUNC.\n\t* \"Avg. Cycle Time (Receive Invoice to Approve Invoice)\" is calculated by subtracting the first end time of 'Receive Invoice' events from the last end time of 'Approve Invoice' events, and then taking the average.\n\t* \"PO Item Line Type\" is a straightforward selection of a column from the table.\n4. Finally, we combined the information from the SELECT clause and the table name to create a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query. We used concise language and explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values to make the description easy to understand.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and how it processes data from the \"defaultview-545\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('QUARTER', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME))) AS \"Quarter\", \nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Approve Invoice') - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Receive invoice')) AS \"Avg.
