First, we're selecting two columns:\n\t* Count(distinct TimesheetRecord)\n\t* Count(distinct TimesheetRecord)\n2. Next, we're applying filters to each column:\n\t* First filter: event_name = 'Create Timesheet Record'\n\t* Second filter: event_name IN ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', 'Cancel Timesheet Record')\n3. Then, we're subtracting the second column from the first column.\n4. After that, we're multiplying the result by 100.\n5. Finally, we're selecting the \"ActivityType\" column and ordering the results by the first column in descending order.\n\nThe table name is \"defaultview-197\", and the column names used in the query are:\n\n* TimesheetRecord\n* event_name\n* ActivityType", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(\nCount(distinct TimesheetRecord) \nFILTER \n(WHERE event_name = 'Create Timesheet Record')\n-\n Count(distinct TimesheetRecord) \nFILTER \n(WHERE event_name IN ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', 'Cancel Timesheet Record'))\n)\n/ Count(distinct TimesheetRecord) * 100 AS \"% of not Approved Timesheets\",\n\n\"ActivityType\"  AS \"Activity Type\"\n\n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n\nORDER BY 1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
