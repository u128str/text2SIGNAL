SELECT COUNT(event_name) - This part of the query selects the count of the event_name column from the table.\n2. FILTER (WHERE \"Event Created By User Type\" != 'Dialog') - This part of the query filters the data to only include rows where the value in the \"Event Created By User Type\" column is not 'Dialog'.\n3. / COUNT(event_name) - This part of the query divides the count of event_name by the total count of event_name, which gives us the percentage of event_name that do not have 'Dialog' as the value in the \"Event Created By User Type\" column.\n4. * 100 - This part of the query multiplies the percentage by 100, which gives us the percentage in decimal format.\n5. FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\") - This part of the query specifies the table to use for the data.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Count of event_name where Event Created By User Type is not 'Dialog', divided by total count of event_name, multiplied by 100.
