COUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey): This part of the query counts the number of unique ARUniqueKey values in the selected data.\n3.

COUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey): This part of the query counts the number of unique ARUniqueKey values in the filtered data.\n5. /: This part of the query divides the count of unique ARUniqueKey values in the filtered data by the total count of unique ARUniqueKey values in the selected data.\n6. * 100: This part of the query multiplies the result of the division by 100.\n\nThe resulting calculation gives the percentage of accounts receivable cleared within 1 day from the due date, for every unique ARUniqueKey.
