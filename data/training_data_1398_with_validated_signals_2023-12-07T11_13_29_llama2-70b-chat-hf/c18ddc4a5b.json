Then, it counts the number of distinct case_id values using the COUNT function.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the rows from the \"defaultview-124\" table using the WHERE clause.\n2. Apply a boolean OR operation to the event_name column to check if at least one event_name contains the string '%Update%'.\n3.
