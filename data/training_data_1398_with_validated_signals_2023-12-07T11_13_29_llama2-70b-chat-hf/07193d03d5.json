In this case, it is a single column, \"avg(Scheduled Finish Date - Actual Finish Date)\".\n* The next part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be queried. In this case, it is \"defaultview-183\".\n* The WHERE clause is not present in this query, so we can assume that all records in the table are to be included in the calculation.\n* The GROUP BY clause is also not present, so we can assume that the calculation is to be performed across all records in the table.\n* The HAVING clause is not present either, so we can assume that there are no additional conditions to be applied to the result set.\n* The ORDER BY clause is not present, so we can assume that the result set is not to be sorted.\n* The LIMIT clause is not present, so we can assume that all records in the table are to be included in the calculation.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows:\n\n\"Calculate the average difference between the scheduled finish date and actual finish date for all records in the 'defaultview-183' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n\"Scheduled Finish Date\" - \"Actual Finish Date\" \n)\nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
