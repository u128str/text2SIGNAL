Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n\t* The column names: \"case_id\", \"Last Invoice Payment Date\", and \"Last Invoice Due Date\"\n\t* The filtering conditions: \"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL AND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())\n\t* The aggregation function: COUNT(case_id)\n\t* The calculation: (filtered count / total count) * 100\n2. Breaking down the filtering conditions:\n\t* \"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL: This condition filters for invoices with no payment date.\n\t* \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()): This condition filters for invoices that are overdue, i.e., their due date is before the current day.\n3. Identifying the purpose of the calculation:\n\t* The calculation is aimed at finding the percentage of overdue invoices with no payment date, out of all invoices with no payment date, for the current day.\n4.
