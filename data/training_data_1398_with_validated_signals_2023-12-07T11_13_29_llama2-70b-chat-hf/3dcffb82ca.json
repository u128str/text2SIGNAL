Filter out rejected billing requests. Sort by number of billing documents in ascending order.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. The SIGNAL query is selecting data from a table named \"defaultview-197\".\n2. The query is using the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the \"end_time\" column to the first day of the month. This column is then aliased as \"Clearing Date\".\n3. The query is also selecting the COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) and AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) columns. The AVG_ClearingTime column is calculated by taking the average of the ClearingTime column, but only for rows where the event_name is 'Create Billing Document'.\n4. The query is filtering out rows where the event_name is 'Reject Billing Request%' by using a CASE statement. If the event_name matches this pattern, then the value 1 is returned, otherwise 0 is returned. This column is then aliased as \"Flag\".\n5. The query is using a subquery to retrieve the data from the table. The subquery is selecting data from the \"defaultview-197\" table and flattening it.\n6. The outer query is selecting data from the subquery and filtering out rows where the event_name is not 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n7. Finally, the query is ordering the results by the \"#Billing Docs\" column in ascending order.\n\nBased on the above explanation, the signal_description summarizes the main points of the SIGNAL query in a human-readable format, including the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT  \n\tDATE_TRUNC('month', wa)  AS \"Clearing Date\" ,\n    COUNT(DISTINCT BillingDocument) AS \"#Billing Docs\", \n    AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) AS \"AVG Clearing Time\"\n    \n    FROM (\n  SELECT \n      case_id, \n      --ClearingJournalEntry, \n      end_time AS wa,\n      BillingDocument,\n      event_name, \n      end_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE event_name = 'Create Billing Document') \n          OVER (PARTITION BY BillingDocument ORDER BY end_time)\n      AS AVG_ClearingTime,\n      \n      CASE WHEN event_name LIKE 'Reject Billing Request%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END as Flag \n  FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n\n  )\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable'\n\nORDER BY 2 ASC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
