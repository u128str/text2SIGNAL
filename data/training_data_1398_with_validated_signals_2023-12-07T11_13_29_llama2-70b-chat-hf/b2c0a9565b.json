The first part of the query is SELECT, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. The next part is AVG, which indicates that we want to calculate the average of a set of values.\n3. The third part is ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Approved')))) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))), which is a subquery that calculates the difference between the last END_TIME of 'Personal Data Change WF Approved' events and the first END_TIME of 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated' events.\n4. The final part is FROM \"defaultview-299\", which indicates that we are selecting data from the \"defaultview-299\" table.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is \"Calculate the average time difference between 'Personal Data Change WF Approved' and 'Personal Data Change WF Initiated' events in the 'defaultview-299' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Approved'))) \n- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated')))) \nFROM \"defaultview-299\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
