The column names are 'CASE_ID' and 'Company Code', respectively.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is broken down into its constituent parts to construct the signal_description.\n\n1. SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, COUNT (CASE_ID) and Company Code. The COUNT function is used to count the number of process orders, and the Company Code column is used for grouping.\n2. FROM clause: The query uses the \"defaultview-183\" view as its data source.\n3. WHERE clause: The query filters for events named 'Create Process Order' using the EVENT_NAME column.\n4. GROUP BY clause: The query groups the results by the second column, which is named \"Company Code\".\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining these parts into a human-readable instruction. The table name, column names, and respective values are explicitly referenced in the description to provide clarity. The description is written in a style that mimics how a human would explain the query, using phrases like \"Retrieve the number of process orders created\" and \"grouped by company code\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"#Process Orders\", \"Company Code\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Process Order')\nGROUP BY 2 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
