The subtraction operation involves two subqueries that filter events based on their names and then select their end times. The first subquery selects the last end time of events with the name 'Create PO Item', while the second subquery selects the first end time of events with the name 'Create PR Item'. The subtraction operation calculates the time difference between these two events.\n\nThe query uses the \"defaultview-57\" table, which suggests that the data is related to a specific business process or scenario. The table name is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it is implied by the context in which the query is being executed.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. It also provides a brief description of the calculation being performed, which helps users understand the purpose of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n    (SELECT LAST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item'))\n    -(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n        WHERE event_name IN ('Create PR Item'))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
