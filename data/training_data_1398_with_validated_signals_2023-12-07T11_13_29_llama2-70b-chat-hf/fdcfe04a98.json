In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-217\".\n* The second part of the query is a nested SELECT statement that calculates the last end_time for events with the name \"Change Status to Closed\". This is done using the LAST() function and a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include events with the specified name.\n* The third part of the query is another nested SELECT statement that calculates the first end_time for events with the name \"Change Status to To Do\". This is done using the FIRST() function and a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include events with the specified name.\n* The fourth part of the query is a subtraction operation that subtracts the first end_time from the last end_time. This produces a difference value.\n* The final part of the query is an AVG() function that calculates the average of the difference values.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable description of the query. It includes references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
