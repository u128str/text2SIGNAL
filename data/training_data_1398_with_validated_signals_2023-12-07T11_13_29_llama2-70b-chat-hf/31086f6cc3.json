The first part of the query is a subquery that selects the count of events where the \"Event Created By User Type\" is either 'System' or 'Service'. This is done using a filter clause.\n2. The second part of the query is another subquery that selects the count of all events.\n3. The third part of the query calculates the percentage of events created by system or service users by dividing the result of the first subquery by the result of the second subquery and multiplying by 100.\n4. The final part of the query selects the result of the third part and assigns it to a variable.\n\nWith this understanding, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query by describing each part and its purpose.
