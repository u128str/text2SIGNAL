Understanding the query logic:\n\t* The query selects the average of the difference between the first end time of \"Change Status to In Progress\" events and the last end time of \"Create Issue\" events.\n\t* The query filters the events based on the event name and issue type.\n\t* The results are ordered by the second column (end_time) in descending order.\n4. Crafting the signal description:\n\t* The signal description explains the calculation performed by the query.\n\t* It mentions the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* It provides a brief explanation of the logic behind the query.\n\nThe signal description is a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, which helps users understand the purpose and logic behind the query without having to read the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nTitle ,\n\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))))\n\t-(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Create Issue'))))\n   ) \n\n\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE IssueType = 'Bug'\nORDER BY 2 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
