Converted USD Amount\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\"\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\"\n3. Understanding the query's logic:\n\t+ The query uses the FILTER clause to apply a condition to the data.\n\t+ The condition is that the \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" must be less than the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\".\n\t+ The query then selects the sum of the \"Inv. Converted USD Amount\" column.\n4. Composing the signal_description:\n\t+ We start by mentioning the table name, followed by a brief description of the query's logic.\n\t+ We then list the column names and their respective values that are used in the query.\n\t+ Finally, we summarize the query's purpose in a concise sentence.\n\nNote: The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, it's not a direct copy of the query itself.
