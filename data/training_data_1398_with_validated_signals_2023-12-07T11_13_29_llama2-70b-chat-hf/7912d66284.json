In this case, we are only interested in the COUNT of the case_id column.\n* The FILTER clause is used to filter the rows that we want to include in the output.

In this case, we return 0 for the respective column.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table that we are querying.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER(\nWHERE ((\"Last Inv.
