The filter is applied to the flattened table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query starts by selecting the COUNT of DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\" from the \"defaultview-383\" table. The COUNT is filtered using the FILTER clause, which applies a condition to the data before the aggregation is performed.\n\nInside the FILTER clause, we have the BEHAVIOR function, which is used to define a pattern that matches a subset of the data. The pattern is defined using a combination of conditions on the \"event_name\" and \"ChangeType\" columns. The event_name must contain the string '%Sales%' and the ChangeType must be 'Update'. The BEHAVIOR function returns a table that contains the rows that match the pattern.\n\nThe MATCHES clause is used to apply the pattern to the data in the \"defaultview-383\" table. The MATCHES clause returns a table that contains the rows that match the pattern, and the AS clause gives the table an alias of \"changed\".\n\nFinally, the COUNT is performed on the \"changed\" table, which gives us the number of unique event IDs that match the pattern.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and the conditions applied in the BEHAVIOR function. It also mentions the flattened table, which is the result of the FLATTEN function applied to the \"defaultview-383\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE '%Sales%'\n        AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n      ) AS changed MATCHES (changed)\n  ) AS \"# Changes\"\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
