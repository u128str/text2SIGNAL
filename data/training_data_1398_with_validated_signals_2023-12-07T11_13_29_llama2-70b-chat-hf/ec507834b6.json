The FILTER clause is applied twice, with two different conditions.\n\t+ The first condition is WHERE (event_name MATCHES('Update PO Item Material'|'Update PO Item Quantity'|'Update PO Item Net Price'|'Update PO Item Plant'|'Update PO Confirmed Delivery Date')). This condition filters the rows where the event_name column matches any of the specified values.\n\t+ The second condition is WHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create PO Item')). This condition filters the rows where the event_name column matches the specified value.\n* Finally, we have the multiplication by 100, which is applied to the result of the two FILTER clauses.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct the signal_description as a set of instructions that describe the query's logic.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (event_name MATCHES(\n    \t('Update PO Item Material'|'Update PO Item Quantity'|\n         'Update PO Item Net Price'|'Update PO Item Plant'|\n          'Update PO Confirmed Delivery Date'))))\n\t/\n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create PO Item'))\n\t)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
