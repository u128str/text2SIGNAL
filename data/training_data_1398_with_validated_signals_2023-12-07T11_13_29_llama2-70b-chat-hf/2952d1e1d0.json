This is describing the column that we want to count, which is the unique key for accounts receivable.\n* The next part is \"FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create Accounts Receivable' AND ClearingJournalEntry IS NULL AND (NOW()-NetDueDate)> DURATION '15day')\". This is describing the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set. The conditions are:\n\t+ EVENT_NAME must be 'Create Accounts Receivable'\n\t+ ClearingJournalEntry must be null\n\t+ The difference between the current date and the NetDueDate must be greater than 15 days\n* The next part is \"as '#Receivables'\". This is an alias for the column that is being counted.\n* The next part is \",  'Project_Manager' as 'Project Manager'\". This is an alias for another column that is being included in the result set.\n* The next part is \"FROM FLATTEN('defaultview-197')\". This is the table that the query is being run on.\n* The next part is \"GROUP BY 2\". This is specifying that the result set should be grouped by the second column (Project Manager).\n* The next part is \"ORDER By 1 DESC\". This is specifying that the result set should be sorted in descending order by the first column (number of receivables).\n* The final part is \"LIMIT 10\".
