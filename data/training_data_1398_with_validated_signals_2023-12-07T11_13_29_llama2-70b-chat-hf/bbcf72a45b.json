Reading the SIGNAL query and identifying the main components, such as the SELECT clause, the FROM clause, the WHERE clause, and the ORDER BY clause.\n2. Understanding the purpose of each component and how they relate to each other. For example, the SELECT clause defines the columns of the output table, while the FROM clause specifies the table to be queried.\n3. Identifying the key concepts and relationships in the query, such as the event categories, change types, and user types.\n4. Using natural language processing techniques to generate a human-readable description of the query, including the table name, column names, and respective values.\n5.
