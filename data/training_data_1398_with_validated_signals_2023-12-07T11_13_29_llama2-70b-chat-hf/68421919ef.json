Understanding the query's logic: The query selects the sum of the \"Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.\" column from the \"defaultview-124\" table where the \"Last FI Invoice Item Due Date\" is less than the \"Last FI Invoice Item Clearing Date\".\n4. Crafting the signal_description: The signal_description is constructed in a human-readable format, describing the query's logic and referencing the table and column names.\n\nThe signal_description is a JSON object with a single key, \"signal_description\", whose value is a string that summarizes the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nSUM(\"Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.\") AS \"Invoice Amount\"\nFROM \n\"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE \"Last FI Invoice Item Due Date\" < \"Last FI Invoice Item Clearing Date\"\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
