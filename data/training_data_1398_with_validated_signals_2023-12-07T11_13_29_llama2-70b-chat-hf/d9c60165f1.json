Breaking down the query into more detailed instructions:\n\t* First, filter the data in the \"defaultview-431\" table by the specified conditions.\n\t* Calculate the count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" for the filtered data.\n\t* Calculate the total count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" for all data in the table.\n\t* Divide the count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" for rejected PO items by the total count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" to get the percentage.\n3. Translating the instructions into a human-readable description, using the table and column names and respective values:\n\t* \"Get the percentage of rejected PO items that are catalog items.\"\n\t* \"Filter the results by 'Last Invoice Id'.\"\n\t* \"Calculate the percentage by dividing the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' for rejected PO items by the total count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id'.\"\n4.
