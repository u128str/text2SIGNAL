This is described as \"Calculate the number of posts created by system or service users.\"\n\t+ The second column is the sum of a subquery that counts the number of case_id where the event_name is like '%Post%'. This is described as \"Calculate the total number of posts.\"\n* Next, we have a FROM clause that specifies the table name as \"defaultview-225\".\n* Finally, we have a WHERE clause that filters the results to only include rows where the event_name is like '%Post%'.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by concatenating these parts into a single string, using natural language to describe the logic of the query.
