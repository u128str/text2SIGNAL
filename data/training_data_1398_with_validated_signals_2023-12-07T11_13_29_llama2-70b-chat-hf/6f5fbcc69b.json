Next, we identified the column names and their respective values used in the query:\n\t* COUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"Cases\" - This line calculates the count of the \"case_id\" column in the table.\n\t* NOW() - This function returns the current date and time.\n\t* LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO' - This line retrieves the last end time of an event named 'Release PO'.\n\t* DURATION '45DAYS' - This line represents a duration of 45 days.\n3. Then, we constructed the signal_description by describing the query's purpose in a human-readable format, using the identified column names and values.\n\nThe signal_description is a summary of the SIGNAL query, describing what the query does and what it returns.
