In this case, we have two columns: \"Inv. Company Code Text\" and COUNT(\"Inv. Accounting Document Number\").\n* The next part is FROM, which specifies the table or view from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-225\".\n* The GROUP BY clause specifies that the data should be grouped by the first column, which is \"Inv. Company Code Text\".\n* The ORDER BY clause specifies that the data should be sorted in descending order by the second column, which is \"No. of Invoices\".\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is: \"Retrieve the Company Code Text and count the number of Invoices for each company, grouped by company, and sorted in descending order by the number of invoices.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \"Inv.
