This tells us that the query is selecting a count of the \"case_id\" column from the table.\n* The next part of the query is \", PO Net Payment Days, PO Terms of Payment Key, PO Vendor Master Net Payment Days, PO Vendor Master Terms of Payment Key, FI Invoice Item Net Payment Days, FI Invoice Item Terms of Payment Key, Last FI Invoice Item Net Payment Days, Last FI Invoice Item Terms of Payment Key\".
