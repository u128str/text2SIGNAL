Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: AVG(expression)\n\t* FILTER clause: WHERE expression\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-270\"\n2. Breaking down the expression in the SELECT clause:\n\t* \"Order Actual Completion\" - \"Order Scheduled Completion\"\n3. Identifying the column names and their respective values used in the expression:\n\t* \"Order Actual Completion\"\n\t* \"Order Scheduled Completion\"\n4. Constructing the human-readable description:\n\t* Start with a brief summary of the calculation: \"Calculate the average difference between the actual and scheduled completion times of orders\"\n\t* Add a condition to filter the orders: \"only considering orders where the actual completion time is greater than the scheduled completion time by at least 1 minute\"\n\t* Use natural language to make the description more readable: \"only considering orders where the actual completion time is greater than the scheduled completion time by at least 1 minute\"\n5. Formatting the description in JSON format:\n\t* Wrap the description in curly braces { }\n\t* Use double quotes for the description text\n\t* Use a colon : after the key \"signal_description\"\n\nThe resulting JSON output is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average difference between the actual and scheduled completion times of orders, only considering orders where the actual completion time is greater than the scheduled completion time by at least 1 minute.\"\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
