First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n2. Next, we looked at the SELECT clause, which contains two columns: \"Week\" and \"No. of ODO Items\". We noted that \"Week\" is calculated using the DATE_TRUNC function with the 'quarter' parameter and the SELECT FIRST function, which returns the first end time in the table. \"No. of ODO Items\" is simply a count of the case_id column.\n3. We then examined the FROM clause, which specifies the table name and the column(s) used in the query. In this case, we have \"defaultview-545\" and no explicit column names.\n4. The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by the first column (Week) in ascending order, with NULLS FIRST.\n5. Finally, we have the FILL TIMESERIES function, which fills in missing values in the time series data.\n\nBased on this analysis, we constructed the signal_description as a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    DATE_TRUNC('quarter', (SELECT FIRST(end_time))) as Week,\n    count(case_id) AS \"No. of ODO Items\"\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('QUARTER'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
