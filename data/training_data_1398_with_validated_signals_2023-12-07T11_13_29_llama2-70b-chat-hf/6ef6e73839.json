{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' from the 'defaultview-545' table where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is less than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' from the 'defaultview-545' table where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is less than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date'.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using a combination of SQL and Signavio-specific syntax.\n\n* SELECT clause: The SELECT clause retrieves the count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n* FILTER clause: The FILTER clause filters the results to only include rows where the \"Last Invoice Due Date\" is less than the \"Last Invoice Payment Date\".\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Identify the table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n2. Identify the column names: \"Last Invoice Id\", \"Last Invoice Due Date\", and \"Last Invoice Payment Date\"\n3. Determine the filter condition: \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < \"Last Invoice Payment Date\"\n4. Determine the aggregation function: COUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\")\n\nWith this information, we can construct the signal_description as a human-readable instruction that references the table name, column names, and filter condition.\n\nThe resulting signal_description is: \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' from the 'defaultview-545' table where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is less than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date'.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\" ) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < \"Last Invoice Payment Date\"\n      )\n  )\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
