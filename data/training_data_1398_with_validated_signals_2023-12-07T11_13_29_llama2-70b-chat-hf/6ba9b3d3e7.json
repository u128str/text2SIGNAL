Identifying the table name, column names, and respective values used in the SIGNAL query.\n2. Creating a human-readable description of the query by explaining what each part of the query does.\n3.

Formatting the description as a set of instructions, with each step explaining a specific aspect of the query.\n5. Using proper punctuation and grammar to make the description easy to read and understand.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the signal_description:\n\n* \"Retrieve the supplier ID\" - This instruction explains that the query retrieves a specific column from the table.\n* \"sum of last invoice item amount\" - This instruction explains that the query calculates the sum of a specific column.\n* \"and count of invoices\" - This instruction explains that the query also calculates the count of rows in the table.\n* \"from the 'defaultview-545' table\" - This instruction specifies the table name and indicates that the query applies to a specific table.\n* \"where the last invoice due date is before the last invoice payment date\" - This instruction explains the condition that must be met for a row to be included in the query results.\n* \"Order the results by the invoice amount in descending order\" - This instruction explains how the query results should be sorted.\n* \"with nulls placed last\" - This instruction explains that null values should be placed at the end of the sorted results.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query does and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"PO Item Supplier ID\"   AS \"Supplier ID\",\n  SUM (\"Last Invoice Item Amount\" ) AS \"Invoice Amount\",\n  COUNT(case_id) AS \"Number of Invoices\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-545\"\nWHERE\n  (\n    \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < \"Last Invoice Payment Date\"\n  )\nORDER BY\n  2 DESC\nNULLS LAST \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
