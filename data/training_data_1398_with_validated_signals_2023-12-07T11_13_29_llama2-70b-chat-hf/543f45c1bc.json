This subquery is filtered using the \"WHERE\" clause.\n* The second part of the query is another subquery that selects the count of \"PR Id\" columns where the \"event_name\" is like '%PR%'. This subquery is also filtered using the \"WHERE\" clause.\n* The third part of the query calculates the percentage of PRs created by System or Service users by dividing the result of the first subquery by the result of the second subquery and multiplying the result by 100.\n\nThe signal_description is a human-readable description of the query that refers to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
