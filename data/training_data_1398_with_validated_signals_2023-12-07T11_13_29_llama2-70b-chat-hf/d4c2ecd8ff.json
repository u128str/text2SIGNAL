Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: This clause selects the columns and expressions that will be used in the final output.\n\t* The SUM clause: This clause calculates the sum of the values in the selected columns.\n\t* The FILTER clause: This clause filters the data based on the specified condition.\n\t* The COUNT clause: This clause counts the number of rows that match the filter condition.\n2. Understanding the table schema:\n\t* The table name is \"defaultview-225\".\n\t* The table has columns named \"EVENT_NAME\", \"Event Created By User Type\".\n3. Analyzing the query:\n\t* The query calculates the percentage of events created by system or service users.\n\t* The query first counts the number of events that have 'System' or 'Service' in the \"Event Created By User Type\" column using the COUNT clause with a FILTER clause.\n\t* The query then calculates the total number of events using the COUNT clause without a filter.\n\t* The query then divides the number of events created by system or service users by the total number of events and multiplies the result by 100.\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed by describing the main components of the query in a human-readable format.\n\t* The description includes the table name, column names, and the respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description is written in a way that explains the purpose of the query and the calculations performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  SUM (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (EVENT_NAME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            (\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System','Service'))\n        )\n    )\n  ) / SUM (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        COUNT (EVENT_NAME)\n    )\n  ) * 100\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
