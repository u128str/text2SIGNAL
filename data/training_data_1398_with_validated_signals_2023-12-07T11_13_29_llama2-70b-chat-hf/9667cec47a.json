The cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first end time from the last end time for each process instance.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is \"SELECT AVG((SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))\". This is a SELECT statement that calculates the average of a difference between two values.\n* The second part of the query is \"AS 'AVG Cycle Time'\". This part defines an alias for the calculated value, which is 'AVG Cycle Time'.\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-545'\". This part specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the signal_description was constructed as follows:\n\n* The first sentence \"Calculate the average cycle time for the process instances in the 'defaultview-545' table.\" provides an overview of the query's purpose.\n* The second sentence \"The cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first end time from the last end time for each process instance.\" provides a detailed explanation of how the calculation is performed.\n\nThe table name, column names and respective values used in the Signal query are:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n* Column names: \"end_time\" (twice)\n* Respective values: None, as the query does not filter or group by any specific values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG((SELECT LAST(end_time))\n\t\t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))\nAS \"AVG Cycle Time\"\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
