Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-222\".\n2. Identifying the column names used in the query:\n\t* \"AmountInGlobalCurrency\"\n\t* \"event_name\"\n\t* \"ClearingDate\"\n\t* \"NetDueDate\"\n3. Understanding the filter conditions:\n\t* \"event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\" - This condition filters the records to only those where the event name is 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\t* \"ClearingDate IS NULL\" - This condition filters the records to only those where the ClearingDate is null.\n\t* \"(NOW()-NetDueDate)> DURATION '15day'\" - This condition filters the records to only those where the difference between the current date and the NetDueDate is greater than 15 days.\n4. Understanding the calculation:\n\t* \"SELECT SUM(\"AmountInGlobalCurrency\" )\" - This calculates the sum of the AmountInGlobalCurrency column for all records that pass the filter conditions.\n5. Combining the information to create the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the Signal query.
