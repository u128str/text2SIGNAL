Breaking down the SELECT clause into its parts:\n\t* COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE \"CostDoc_EnterDocAfterProjectClosingCount\" > 0): This part calculates the number of case IDs that have at least one cost document entered after project closing.\n\t* / COUNT(case_id): This part calculates the total number of case IDs.\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-197\"\n\t* Column names: \"CostDoc_EnterDocAfterProjectClosingCount\", \"case_id\"\n4.
