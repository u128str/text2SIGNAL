First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-431\".\n2. Next, we identified the column names used in the query:\n\t* \"PO ID\"\n\t* \"Last PR Id\"\n3. We then determined the purpose of the query, which is to count the number of distinct PO IDs that do not have a corresponding PR ID.\n4. Finally, we constructed the signal_description by combining the table name, column names, and the purpose of the query into a human-readable instruction.\n\nThe signal_description is written in a style that is easy to understand for a person who knows the table schema and the data it contains.
