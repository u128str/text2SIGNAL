SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, \"Overdue Category\" and \"#Receivables\".\n2. CASE clause: The query uses a CASE clause to define seven overdue categories based on the difference between the current date (NOW()) and the NetDueDate. Each category is defined by a range of dates, and the corresponding value for that category is returned.\n3. FROM clause: The query is applied to a flattened view called \"defaultview-222\".\n4. WHERE clause: The query filters for records where NetDueDate is not null, event_name is 'Create Accounts Receivable', ClearingDate is null, and the current date is greater than or equal to NetDueDate.\n5. ORDER BY clause: The query sorts the results by the \"Overdue Category\" column in ascending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query's purpose and the logic used to determine the overdue categories.
