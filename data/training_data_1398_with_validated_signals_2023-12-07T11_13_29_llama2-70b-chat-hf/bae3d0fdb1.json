{"signal_description": "Counts the number of unique event names in the 'defaultview-124' flattened view.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Counts the number of unique event names in the 'defaultview-124' flattened view.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT EVENT_NAME) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")` can be broken down into several parts:\n\n1. `SELECT`: This is the selection clause of the query, which specifies the columns to be included in the output. In this case, we are selecting a single column, `COUNT(DISTINCT EVENT_NAME)`.\n2. `COUNT(DISTINCT EVENT_NAME)`: This is the aggregation function used to count the number of unique event names. The `COUNT` function returns the number of rows in the table that have a non-null value for the specified column. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique values are counted.\n3. `FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")`: This is the table source clause of the query, which specifies the table to be queried. In this case, we are querying a flattened view named \"defaultview-124\".\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows: \"Counts the number of unique event names in the 'defaultview-124' flattened view.\" This description explicitly references the table name (\"defaultview-124\"), column name (EVENT_NAME), and the aggregation function used (COUNT(DISTINCT)).\n\nThe JSON output format was chosen to provide a concise and easy-to-consume format for the signal description. The resulting JSON object contains a single property, \"signal_description\", with the human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as its value.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(DISTINCT EVENT_NAME) \nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
