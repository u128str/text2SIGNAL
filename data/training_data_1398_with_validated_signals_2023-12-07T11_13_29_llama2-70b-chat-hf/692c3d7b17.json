The query can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. The query starts by selecting various columns from a subquery that filters the data to only include invoices with a clearing date before the current date.\n2. The subquery calculates the payment block rate, rework percentage, and change percentage using counts, sums, and averages.\n3. The results are then grouped by company code and ordered by the invoice amount in descending order.\n4. The final query selects the desired columns from the subquery and renames them for readability.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the query's purpose and functionality.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"Inv.
