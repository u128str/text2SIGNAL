SELECT clause: The query selects the average of a calculation that is performed on two subqueries.\n2. First subquery: This subquery retrieves the last end time of events with the name 'Create Sales Order Item'. The subquery uses the NOW() function to calculate the current time, and then subtracts the last end time from it to get the time difference. The time difference is limited to 3000 days.\n3. Second subquery: This subquery retrieves the first end time of events with the name 'Create Quotation Item'.\n4. Calculation: The difference between the last end time of 'Create Sales Order Item' events and the first end time of 'Create Quotation Item' events is calculated.\n5. Column alias: The calculated value is given the alias \"Lead time: sales document item creation to delivery creation\".\n6. Table name: The data is retrieved from the \"defaultview-290\" table.\n7.
