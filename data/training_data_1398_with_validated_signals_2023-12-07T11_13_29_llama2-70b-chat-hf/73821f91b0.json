First, we select the case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, BillingDocument, event_name, and end_time columns from the \"defaultview-197\" table.\n2. Next, we use a CASE statement to create a new column called AVG_ClearingTime. This column contains the average of the time differences between the end time and the first end time for each billing document. The time difference is calculated using the FIRST function, which returns the first value of the end time column for each billing document. The FILTER clause is used to only include rows where the event_name is 'Create Billing Document'.\n3. The resulting table is then partitioned by BillingDocument and ordered by end_time.\n4. Finally, the AVG function is used to calculate the average of the AVG_ClearingTime column for each billing document.\n5. The query then filters the results to only include rows where the event_name is 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the main steps and referencing the table and column names.
