First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-431\".\n2. Then, we looked at the SELECT clause, which specifies the columns to be retrieved. In this case, we are interested in the \"PO Item Total Amount\" column.\n3. Next, we examined the FILTER clause, which filters the rows based on the \"PO Item Line Type\" column. We noted that the filter condition is \"PO Item Line Type\" = 'Catalog'.\n4. Finally, we observed that the query multiplies the sum of \"PO Item Total Amount\" by 100.\n\nWith this information, we constructed the signal_description as a set of instructions that explain what the query does.
