The subquery uses the 'last' and 'first' aggregate functions to retrieve the desired timestamps, and the 'filter' function to filter the events based on their names. The outer query filters the results to only include rows where the 'Planned Order Number' column is not null.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the last 'Deletion Flag' event and the first 'Create Process Order' event for each planned order.\n2. Calculate the time difference between the two events.\n3. Average the time differences for all planned orders.\n\nThe resulting signal description clearly communicates these steps and references the relevant table, column names, and values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Deletion Flag')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NOT NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
