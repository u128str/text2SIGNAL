{"signal_description": "For each unique ARUniqueKey, calculate the percentage of accounts receivable cleared when the event name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and AutomationFlag is null, out of all accounts receivable cleared with the event name 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"For each unique ARUniqueKey, calculate the percentage of accounts receivable cleared when the event name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and AutomationFlag is null, out of all accounts receivable cleared with the event name 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its components and understanding what each part does.\n\n* The first part of the query is `SELECT (count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and AutomationFlag is null))`. This part calculates the number of unique ARUniqueKey values that have an event name of 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and AutomationFlag is null.\n* The second part of the query is `count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Accounts Receivable'))`. This part calculates the total number of unique ARUniqueKey values that have an event name of 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n* The third part of the query is `* 100`. This part converts the result of the previous two parts into a percentage.\n* The last part of the query is `FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")`. This part specifies the table to use for the query, which in this case is a flattened view called \"defaultview-222\".\n\nWith this understanding, we can construct the signal_description by describing what the query does for each part. The first part calculates the number of unique ARUniqueKey values that meet certain criteria, the second part calculates the total number of unique ARUniqueKey values for the same criteria, and the third part converts the result into a percentage. Finally, the query is applied to the flattened view \"defaultview-222\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER\n(WHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and AutomationFlag is null)\n/ \ncount(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FILTER \n(WHERE event_name IN \n('Clear Accounts Receivable')\n)\n) \n* 100\n FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
