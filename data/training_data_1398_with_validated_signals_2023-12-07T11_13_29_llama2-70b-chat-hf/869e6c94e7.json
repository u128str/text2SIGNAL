The calculation is based on the 'event_name' column in the 'Flatten(\"defaultview-183\")' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using the following steps:\n\n1. The first line, \"SELECT count(event_name) Filter(Where \\\"Event Created By User Type\\\" not in ('Dialog'))\", selects the count of the 'event_name' column in the 'Flatten(\"defaultview-183\")' table where the value in the 'Event Created By User Type' column is not in the list ['Dialog'].\n2. The second line, \"/ count(event_name)*100\", calculates the percentage of the selected count by dividing it by the total count of the 'event_name' column and multiplying the result by 100.\n3. The final line, \"FROM Flatten(\\\"defaultview-183\\\")\", specifies the table to use for the query.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the main components of the query:\n\t* The table name: \"Flatten(\\\"defaultview-183\\\")\"\n\t* The column names: \"event_name\", \"Event Created By User Type\"\n\t* The filter condition: \"not in ('Dialog')\"\n2. Creating a human-readable description of the query by combining the identified components:\n\t* \"Calculate the percentage of events created by users that are not dialogs.\"\n\t* \"The calculation is based on the 'event_name' column in the 'Flatten(\\\"defaultview-183\\\")' table.\"\n3.
