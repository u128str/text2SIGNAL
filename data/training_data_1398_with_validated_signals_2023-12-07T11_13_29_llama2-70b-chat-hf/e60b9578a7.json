This part is selecting the count of the CASE_ID column and assigning it to a label called \"No. of Cases\".\n* The second part is \"AVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PR item'))) AS 'Avg. Cycle Time (PR to PO Creation)'\". This part is calculating the average cycle time between the \"Create PR item\" and \"Create PO Item\" events. The cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first end time of \"Create PR item\" from the last end time of \"Create PO Item\". The result is then wrapped in an AVG function to give the average cycle time for all cases.\n* The third part is \"\"PO Business Unit\"\". This part is simply selecting the \"PO Business Unit\" column.\n* The final part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-545' ORDER BY 1 DESC LIMIT 100\".
