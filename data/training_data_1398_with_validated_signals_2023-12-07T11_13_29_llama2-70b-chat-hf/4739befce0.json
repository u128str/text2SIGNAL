It then calculates the time difference between the two events for each row in the table.\n\nThe query then filters the results to only include rows where the EVENT_NAME matches the pattern 'Create Issue' followed by 'Change Status to To Do'.\n\nFinally, the query groups the results by the IssueType column and calculates the average time difference for each group.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG ((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Change Status to To Do')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Issue'))), \"IssueType\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to To Do')\nGROUP BY 2 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
