Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from a temporary table named temp.\n\t* The temporary table is created by selecting specific columns from the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") table.\n\t* The selected columns include case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, and end_time.\n\t* The event_name column is filtered to only include rows where the value is 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\t* The end_time column is used to calculate the average clearing time, and the FIRST(end_time) function is used to get the first end time value for each partition.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The first part of the query is SELECT case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, end_time - FIRST(end_time) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\").\n\t* The second part of the query is FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable') OVER (PARTITION BY ARUniqueKey ORDER BY end_time).\n\t* The third part of the query is SELECT AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM temp.\n3. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* The table name is \"defaultview-222\".\n\t* The column names are:\n\t\t+ case_id\n\t\t+ ClearingJournalEntry\n\t\t+ event_name\n\t\t+ end_time\n\t\t+ ARUniqueKey\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It should include the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description should be written in a way that explains the purpose of the query, and what it is trying to achieve.\n\nThe signal_description constructed above explains that the query is calculating the average clearing time for accounts receivable clearing journal entries, based on the 'Create Accounts Receivable' event, partitioned by ARUniqueKey and ordered by end time. It also mentions the table name (\"defaultview-222\") and the column names used in the query (case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, event_name, end_time, and ARUniqueKey).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \n--BillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) \nFILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable') OVER (PARTITION BY ARUniqueKey ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name LIKE 'Clear Accounts Receivable'\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
