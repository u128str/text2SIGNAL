The `count()` function takes an argument, which in this case is `case_id`.\n3. `as \"# Process Orders\"`: This part defines an alias for the column that contains the count of unique case IDs. The alias is denoted by the `as` keyword, followed by the desired name for the column, which in this case is \"# Process Orders\".\n4. `FROM \"defaultview-183\"`: This part specifies the table from which we want to retrieve data. The table name is enclosed in double quotes, which indicates that it is a string literal.\n\nBased on the above analysis, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as follows:\n\n\"Retrieve the number of unique case IDs in the 'defaultview-183' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name (`defaultview-183`) and the column name (`case_id`) used in the query. It also mentions the alias given to the column containing the count of unique case IDs (`# Process Orders`).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) as \"# Process Orders\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
