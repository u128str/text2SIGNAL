The query uses the BEHAVIOR function to check if the event name matches the specified pattern and the created_with_dialog column is set to true. The COUNT function is used to count the number of events that match the filter criteria.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the events from the \"defaultview-291\" table.\n2. Check if the event name starts with 'Update Delivery' or 'Change Delivery' using the BEHAVIOR function.\n3. Check if the created_with_dialog column is set to true.\n4. Count the number of events that match the filter criteria.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and the filter criteria used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(\"event_name\") FILTER (\n        WHERE BEHAVIOR (\n            event_name iLIKE 'Update Delivery%'\n       --     OR event_name iLIKE 'Change Delivery%' \n            ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog))\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-291\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
