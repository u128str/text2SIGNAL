The calculation is based on the difference between the last recorded end time of an event named 'Post Goods Issue' and the first recorded end time of an event named 'Create Outbound Delivery'.

SELECT clause: The query selects the average of a calculation that is performed on two subqueries.\n2. First subquery: This subquery selects the last recorded end time of an event named 'Post Goods Issue' that occurs within 3000 days before the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event. The subquery uses the NOW() function to calculate the current time, and then subtracts the last recorded end time of the 'Post Goods Issue' event to get the time difference.\n3. Second subquery: This subquery selects the first recorded end time of an event named 'Create Outbound Delivery'.\n4. Calculation: The time difference calculated in the first subquery is subtracted from the first recorded end time of the 'Create Outbound Delivery' event to get the lead time.\n5. FROM clause: The query is applied to a specific view named \"defaultview-290\".\n6. ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses: The results are sorted in descending order and limited to 5 rows.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the SIGNAL query.
