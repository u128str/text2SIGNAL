The last and first functions are used to get the last and first values of the end_time column, respectively. The minus sign (-) operator is used to subtract the first value from the last value. The AVG function is used to calculate the average of the resulting values.\n* FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))) : This part of the query filters the data to only include events created by user types 'System' or 'Service'. The BOOL_OR function is used to check if the value in the \"Event Created By User Type\" column is either 'System' or 'Service'. The WHERE clause is used to filter the data based on the result of the BOOL_OR function.\n* FROM \"defaultview-124\" : This part of the query specifies the table to use for the query. The table name is \"defaultview-124\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time of events filtered by events created by user type, either system or service, in the defaultview-124 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(AVG((SELECT last(end_time)) - (SELECT first(end_time))) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR(\"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('System', 'Service')))))\n\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
