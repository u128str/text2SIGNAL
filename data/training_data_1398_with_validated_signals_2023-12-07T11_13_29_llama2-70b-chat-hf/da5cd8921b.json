First, we extract the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table: \"defaultview-545\"\n\t* Columns: END_TIME, PO_ITEM_LINE_TYPE\n2. Next, we identify the main objective of the query:\n\t* Calculate the average cycle time for PO Item Line Type on a quarterly basis.\n3. We then break down the query into its main components:\n\t* Component 1: DATE_TRUNC('QUARTER', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME))) AS \"Quarter\"\n\t\t+ This part of the query truncates the last end time to the quarter level.\n\t* Component 2: AVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME)) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME))) AS \"Avg. Cycle Time\"\n\t\t+ This part calculates the average time difference between the last and first end times.\n\t* Component 3: \"PO Item Line Type\"\n\t\t+ This part selects the PO Item Line Type column.\n\t* Component 4: ORDER BY 3, 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\n\t\t+ This part orders the results by PO Item Line Type and quarter.\n4.
