The cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first 'END_TIME' value from the last 'END_TIME' value for each process instance.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe SIGNAL query uses the SELECT statement to retrieve the average cycle time for process instances in the 'defaultview-124' table. The query uses two subqueries to retrieve the first and last 'END_TIME' values for each process instance. The difference between these two values is calculated and then averaged across all process instances to produce the final result.\n\nThe table name 'defaultview-124' is explicitly referenced in the FROM clause of the query. The column names 'END_TIME' and 'FIRST' are also explicitly referenced in the subqueries. The values of these columns are used in the calculation of the cycle time.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query in a human-readable format, highlighting the key elements of the query such as the table name, column names, and the calculation performed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG((SELECT LAST (\"END_TIME\") -  FIRST(\"END_TIME\"))) AS \"Avg.
