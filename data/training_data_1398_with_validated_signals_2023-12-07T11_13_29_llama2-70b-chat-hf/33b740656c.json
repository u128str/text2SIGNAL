In this case, we are only interested in the count of case IDs that meet a certain condition.\n* The condition is specified in the FILTER clause, which applies a duration filter to the difference between the \"Actual Start Date\" and \"Scheduled Start Date\" columns. The filter only includes rows where the difference is greater than 0 seconds.\n* Finally, we have the aggregation function COUNT, which counts the number of case IDs that meet the condition. This value is then divided by the total number of case IDs (which is obtained by removing the filter), and multiplied by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"For the defaultview-183 table, calculate the percentage of cases where the actual start date is later than the scheduled start date, by counting the number of case IDs that meet this condition, dividing it by the total number of case IDs, and multiplying the result by 100.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (count(case_id)\nFILTER (WHERE \"Actual Start Date\" - \"Scheduled Start Date\" > DURATION '0seconds')\n /\n count(case_id)) \n *100\n \n  FROM \"defaultview-183\"\n\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
