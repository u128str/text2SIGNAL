The query is filtering the data from the \"defaultview-404\" table based on two conditions:\n\n1. The event_name is in ('Review Sales Forecast') and the end_time is not null.\n2. The Sales Forecast Qty is not zero.\n\nThe first condition is applied using the FILTER function, which filters the data based on the specified condition. The second condition is applied using the WHERE clause.\n\nThe COUNT function is used to count the number of case_id that meet the above conditions. The result is then divided by the total count of case_id to get the percentage.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE(\n\t(SELECT FIRST(\"end_time\")\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Review Sales Forecast') \n\t\t) IS NOT NULL\n\t)\t\n)\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"Sales Forecast Qty\" <> 0\n)* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
