This is described as \"Retrieve the first day of each month\".\n* The second part of the query uses COUNT(case_id) to count the number of invoices for each month. This is described as \"Retrieve the number of invoices for each month\".\n* The third part of the query uses AVG to calculate the average cycle time for each month. The cycle time is calculated as the difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event time and the first 'Post Invoice' event time for each invoice. This is described as \"Calculate the average cycle time for each month\".\n* The fourth part of the query uses a subquery to filter the results to only include invoices with 'Post Invoice' and 'Clear Invoice' events. This is described as \"Filter the results to only include invoices with 'Post Invoice' and 'Clear Invoice' events\".\n* The final part of the query uses ORDER BY to sort the results by month ascending, with null values filled in the time series.
