The first part of the query is a SELECT statement that retrieves the average of a calculated value.\n2. The calculated value is the result of a nested SELECT statement that filters the events with names containing 'Update'.\n3. The nested SELECT statement retrieves the count of events with names containing 'Update' using the ILIKE operator.\n4. The filtered count is then divided by the total count of events in the table, which is retrieved using a second nested SELECT statement.\n5. The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n6. Finally, the result is selected from the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by breaking down the query into its components and describing each part in a human-readable format. The table name, column names, and respective values are explicitly referenced in the description to provide clarity.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT COUNT(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE event_name ILIKE '%Update%')\n\t) / (SELECT COUNT(event_name))\n   ) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
