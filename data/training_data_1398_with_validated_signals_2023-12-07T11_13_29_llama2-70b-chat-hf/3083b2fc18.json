Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: The query selects a single column, which is the result of a nested SELECT statement.\n\t* SUM and COUNT functions: The nested SELECT statement uses the SUM and COUNT functions to calculate the number of CASE_IDs that match the filter condition.\n\t* FILTER clause: The filter clause filters the events based on the EVENT_NAME being in the specified list.\n\t* FROM clause: The query is applied to the \"defaultview-299\" table.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The nested SELECT statement calculates the count of CASE_IDs that have an EVENT_NAME in the specified list.\n\t* The SUM function calculates the total count of CASE_IDs.\n\t* The COUNT function calculates the total number of CASE_IDs that have an EVENT_NAME in the specified list.\n3. Converting the query into a human-readable description:\n\t* The description starts by stating the main objective of the query, which is to calculate the percentage of Personal Data Change WF Initiated events.\n\t* It then lists the tables and columns used in the query, specifically mentioning the \"defaultview-299\" table and the CASE_ID and EVENT_NAME columns.\n\t* The description then explains the filter condition and how the SUM and COUNT functions are used to calculate the desired percentage.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM ((SELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (EVENT_NAME IN ('Personal Data Change WF Initiated'))))) / COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-299\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
