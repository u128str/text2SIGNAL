FROM clause:\n\t* The query is executed on the \"defaultview-404\" table.\n4. Calculation:\n\t* The result of the FILTER clause is divided by the result of the COUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") clause, and then multiplied by 100.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.
