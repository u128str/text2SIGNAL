SELECT clause: COUNT (CASE_ID) - This part of the query indicates that we want to retrieve the count of a specific column, CASE_ID.\n2. FILTER clause: WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1) - This part of the query specifies a condition for filtering the data. The condition is based on a subquery that checks if the occurrence of an event (EVENT_NAME) is greater than 1. The subquery uses the OCCURRENCE function to extract the occurrence of the event.\n3. FROM clause: \"defaultview-545\" - This part of the query specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved.\n\nBased on these parts, the signal_description is constructed as a human-readable instruction that summarizes the query. It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. The description is written in a style that a human who knows the table schema and respective values would use to explain the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1) \n    \tFROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(EVENT_NAME) AS occurrence) AS sub))\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
