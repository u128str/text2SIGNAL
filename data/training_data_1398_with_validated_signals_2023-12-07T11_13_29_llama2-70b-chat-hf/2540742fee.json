In this case, we are interested in the COUNT of the \"case_id\" column.\n* The FILTER clause is used to filter the rows that should be counted. It specifies three conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the count:\n\t+ The value in the \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" column must be less than the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1\" column.\n\t+ The value in the \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\" column must be less than the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\" column, or the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\" column must be NULL.\n\t+ The value in the \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" column must be less than the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\" column, or the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\" column must be NULL.\n* Finally, we have the /COUNT(case_id) * 100 part, which calculates the percentage of the total count of \"case_id\" that meets the above conditions.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Count of case_id where Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1 is less than Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1, or Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2 is less than Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2, or Last Inv.
