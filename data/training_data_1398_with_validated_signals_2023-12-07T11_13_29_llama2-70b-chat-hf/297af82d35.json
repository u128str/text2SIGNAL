The data is filtered using the 'Receive Invoice' event name and the start and end times are truncated to the first day of the month.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its component parts and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n1. SELECT clause:\nThe query selects three columns: \"Receive Invoice\", \"Manual reconciled invoices Over Time\", and a calculated column that represents the ratio of manually reconciled invoices to total invoices.\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe DATE_TRUNC function is used to truncate the start and end times of the event_time column to the first day of the month. This is done to aggregate the data by month.\n3. FIRST function:\nThe FIRST function is used to retrieve the first value of the end_time column that matches the filter criteria. This is done to get the start time of the first invoice received in each month.\n4. FILTER clause:\nThe FILTER clause is used to filter the data based on two conditions:\n* The event_name must be 'Receive Invoice'\n* The last invoice reconciliation status must be 'Reconciling' and the last invoice submission method must be 'PaperInvoice'\n5. COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") and COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") FILTER clause:\nThe first COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") calculates the total number of distinct invoice IDs that match the filter criteria. The second COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") calculates the number of distinct invoice IDs that have a last invoice reconciliation status of 'Reconciling' and a last invoice submission method of 'PaperInvoice'.\n6. Calculated column:\nThe calculated column is the ratio of the number of manually reconciled invoices (i.e., the second COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\")) to the total number of invoices (i.e., the first COUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\")). This ratio is then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n7. ORDER BY clause:\nThe data is sorted by the first column (i.e., \"Receive Invoice\") in ascending order, with NULL values appearing first.\n8. FILL TIMESERIES function:\nThe FILL TIMESERIES function is used to fill in missing values in the time series data. In this case, it fills in the missing months with NULL values.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, which can help users understand the query's purpose and how it was constructed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Receive Invoice')))) AS \"Receive Invoice\",\n    \n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling'\n    \tAND \"Last Invoice Submission Method\"= 'PaperInvoice'\n\t\t)\n\t/\n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Invoice ID\") FILTER (\n\t\t\tWHERE \"Last Invoice Reconciliation Status\" = 'Reconciling'\n\t\t)     \n\t* 100 AS \"Manual reconciled invoices Over Time\"\n                \nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
