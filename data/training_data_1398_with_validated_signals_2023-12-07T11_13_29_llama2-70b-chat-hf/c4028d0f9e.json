In this case, it's COUNT(case_id), which counts the number of unique case_ids in the table.\n* FILTER: The query then applies a filter to the data, only including rows where the event_name column matches two specific patterns: 'Update Baseline Date' and 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Update Baseline Date'. The '~>' operator is used to indicate a regular expression pattern.\n* COUNT(case_id): The query then counts the number of case_ids that pass the filter.\n* /COUNT(case_id): The result of the count is then divided by the total number of case_ids in the table.\n* * 100: The result of the division is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n* FROM \"defaultview-59\": The query is applied to the table named \"defaultview-59\".\n\nThe signal_description explains the purpose of the query, describing what data is being selected, how it's being filtered, and what calculations are being performed.
