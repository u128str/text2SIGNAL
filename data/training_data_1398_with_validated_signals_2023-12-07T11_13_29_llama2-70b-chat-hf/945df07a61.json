It selects the sum of the 'RejectedCount' column from the 'BillingRequest' table in the 'defaultview-197' view.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we can break down the query into its constituent parts:\n\n1. SELECT: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. SUM: This function aggregates the values of the specified column. In this case, we are summing up the values in the 'RejectedCount' column.\n3. \"BillingRequest_RejectedCount\": This is the column name we are summing up. It is a concatenation of the table name 'BillingRequest' and the column name 'RejectedCount', separated by an underscore.\n4. FROM: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a specific table or view.\n5. \"defaultview-197\": This is the name of the view we are selecting data from.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should clearly convey the intention of the query, which is to retrieve the sum of the 'RejectedCount' column in the 'BillingRequest' table from the 'defaultview-197' view.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nSUM(\"BillingRequest_RejectedCount\")\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
