The first line selects a column that contains a boolean value indicating whether the occurrence of an event is greater than 1. This is done using a subquery that selects the occurrence of an event from a table named \"defaultview-59\" and then applies a boolean OR operation to check if any of the occurrences are greater than 1.\n2. The second line filters the rows of the table to only include those where the boolean value selected in step 1 is true.\n3. The third line calculates the percentage of filtered rows out of all rows in the table.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the main operation performed by the query, which is calculating a percentage.\n2. Describing the input data used for the calculation, which is the table \"defaultview-59\" and the column \"case_id\".\n3. Explaining the condition used for filtering the data, which is the occurrence of an event being greater than 1.\n4. Providing the formula used for the calculation, which is 100 - (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1))/COUNT(case_id)*100).\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the query's purpose and how it operates on the input data.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n100 - (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE\n\t(SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM (SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub\n)\n)/COUNT(case_id)*100)\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
