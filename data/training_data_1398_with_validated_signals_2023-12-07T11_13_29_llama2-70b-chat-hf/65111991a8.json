This is done by using the 'month' parameter and passing in the first end time where the event name is 'Change Status to Closed'. This gives us the first day of the month for each closed issue.\n\nThe query then uses a subquery to retrieve the last end time for each event where the event name is 'Change Status to Closed'. This subquery is filtered to only include events where the event name matches 'Change Status to In Progress' followed by 'Change Status to Closed'. This gives us the last end time for each closed issue that was previously in progress.\n\nThe query then calculates the duration between the first end time and the last end time for each closed issue, and filters out any issues that do not have a resolution status.\n\nFinally, the query groups the results by the first column (which contains the month), and orders the results by the first column.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as \"Retrieve the average duration between 'Change Status to In Progress' and 'Change Status to Closed' for each month, where the resolution status is not null.\" This description explicitly references the table name (\"defaultview-217\"), column names (\"end_time\", \"event_name\", and \"ResolutionStatus\"), and respective values (first end time, last end time, and non-null resolution status).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed')) AS \"Month when Issue Closed\",\nAVG( \n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to Closed') \n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress')\n    )\nFILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Progress' ~> 'Change Status to Closed') ) AS \"Duration\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE \"ResolutionStatus\" IS NOT NULL\nGROUP BY 1\nORDER BY 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
