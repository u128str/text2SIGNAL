Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-43\"\n2. Understanding the query structure:\n\t* The query selects the average of a subtraction operation.\n\t* The subtraction operation involves two selects:\n\t\t+ The first select retrieves the last 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is in ('Create Invoice Item').\n\t\t+ The second select retrieves the first 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is in ('Post Goods Issue').\n3. Breaking down the query into its components:\n\t* The first component is the subtraction operation:\n\t\t- The first operand is the last 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is in ('Create Invoice Item').\n\t\t- The second operand is the first 'end_time' value where the 'event_name' is in ('Post Goods Issue').\n\t* The second component is the average function:\n\t\t- The average function is applied to the result of the subtraction operation.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is constructed by describing the components of the query in a human-readable format.\n\t* The description includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description is written in a style that resembles a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table schema and the data in the table.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and the data it operates on.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create Invoice Item'))\n\t-\n\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Post Goods Issue'))\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-43\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
