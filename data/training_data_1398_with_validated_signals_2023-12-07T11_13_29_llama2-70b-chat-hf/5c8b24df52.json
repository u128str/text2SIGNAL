In this case, we are interested in the average of the difference between two sets of END_TIME values.\n* The FILTER clause is used to filter the rows based on the EVENT_NAME column. We want to consider only rows where the EVENT_NAME is either 'Approve Invoice' or 'Receive Invoice'.\n* The LAST and FIRST functions are used to get the last and first END_TIME values for the respective event names.\n* The minus sign (-) operator is used to calculate the difference between the last END_TIME of 'Approve Invoice' events and the first END_TIME of 'Receive Invoice' events.\n* The AVG function is used to calculate the average of the differences.\n* The FROM clause specifies the table to be used for the query, which is \"defaultview-431\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should clearly explain the intent of the query, mentioning the table name, column names, and the respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Approve Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-431\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
