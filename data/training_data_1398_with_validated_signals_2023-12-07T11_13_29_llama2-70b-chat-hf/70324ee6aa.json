The values are calculated by subtracting the first end time from the last end time for each row in the \"defaultview-545\" table. The query uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first end times, respectively.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the last end time for each row in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n2. Retrieve the first end time for each row in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n3. Calculate the difference between the last and first end times for each row.\n4. Calculate the median of the differences.\n\nThe resulting median value is the output of the query.\n\nIn the signal_description, we reference the table name, column names, and respective values as follows:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n* Column names: end_time (used twice)\n* Respective values: LAST(end_time) and FIRST(end_time)\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by describing the steps involved in the query, using phrases that are easy to understand for a human reader. The phrases are concatenated to form a single sentence that summarizes the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nMEDIAN((SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
