This is done using the FIRST function, which returns the first value in the end time column.\n* The second part of the query filters the records based on a condition. The condition is that the difference between the first end time where the event name is 'Change Status to To Do' and the first end time where the event name is 'Create Issue' is greater than 10 days. This is done using the FILTER function, which applies a filter to the data based on the given condition.\n* The third part of the query groups the remaining records by day, using the ORDER BY function to sort the data by the day column in ascending order, with NULL values placed first.\n* The final part of the query uses the FILL function to fill in missing values in the timeseries column, with NULL values filled in first.\n\nBased on these components, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.
