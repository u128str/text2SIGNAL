Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-183\".\n2. Identifying the column names and their respective values that are used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"Scheduled Release Date\"\n\t* \"Actual Release Date\"\n\t* DURATION '0seconds' (a duration value of 0 seconds)\n3. Understanding the query's logic:\n\t* The query selects the average of the difference between \"Scheduled Release Date\" and \"Actual Release Date\" for all rows in the table.\n\t* The difference is calculated by subtracting \"Actual Release Date\" from \"Scheduled Release Date\".\n\t* The query filters the rows to only include those where the difference is greater than 0 seconds.\n4. Composing the signal_description:\n\t* We start with the phrase \"Calculate the average difference between\" followed by the column names separated by a space.\n\t* We then specify the table name, followed by a WHERE clause that describes the filter condition.\n\t* Finally, we end with the phrase \"for all rows in\" followed by the table name.\n\nNote that the signal_description is a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query and is not a literal translation of the query.
