SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are retrieving data from a table.\n2. COUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\"): The COUNT function is used to count the number of distinct values in the \"Last Invoice Id\" column. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each value is only counted once, even if there are multiple rows with the same value.\n3. FILTER (WHERE \"PO ID\" IS NULL): The FILTER clause is used to filter the results of the query based on a condition. In this case, we are only including rows where the \"PO ID\" column is null.\n4. FROM \"defaultview-431\": The FROM clause specifies the table from which we are retrieving data. In this case, we are using a table named \"defaultview-431\".\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that clearly explains what data is being retrieved and how it is being filtered.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\")FILTER (WHERE \"PO ID\" IS NULL) AS \"# PO without Invoice\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
