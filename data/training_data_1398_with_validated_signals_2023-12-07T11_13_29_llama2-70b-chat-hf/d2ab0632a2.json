SELECT clause: The query selects the AVG (average) of a calculated field.\n2. Calculated field: The calculated field is the difference between \"Order Actual Start\" and \"Order Scheduled Start\".\n3. FILTER clause: The filter clause restricts the data to only include records where the difference between \"Order Actual Start\" and \"Order Scheduled Start\" is greater than 0 minutes.\n4. FROM clause: The query is applied to the \"defaultview-270\" table.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining the information from each clause in a natural language format. The table and column names are referenced explicitly, and the filter condition is described in plain English.
