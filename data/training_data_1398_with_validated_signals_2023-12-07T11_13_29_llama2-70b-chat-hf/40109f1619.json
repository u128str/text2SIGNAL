The first part of the query is \"SELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'In Planning')\". This part calculates the number of cases that have a \"Project_StageText\" value of \"In Planning\". The \"COUNT\" function is used to count the number of distinct \"case_id\" values that match the filter condition.\n2. The second part of the query is \"/ COUNT(case_id)\". This part calculates the total number of cases in the table, regardless of their \"Project_StageText\" value. The \"COUNT\" function is used again to count the number of distinct \"case_id\" values.\n3. The third part of the query is \"* 100\". This part converts the result of the previous calculation into a percentage.\n4. The final part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-197'\". This part specifies the table to use for the query.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the percentage of cases in the 'In Planning' stage out of all cases, using data from the 'defaultview-197' table.\" It highlights the key information that the query is trying to retrieve, which is the percentage of cases in a particular stage, and the table that the query is using to retrieve that information.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'In Planning')\n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
