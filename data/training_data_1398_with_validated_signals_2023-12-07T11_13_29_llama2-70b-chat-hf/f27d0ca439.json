The expression is the difference between the last and first end time of all records in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n\nThe query uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first values of the end time column, respectively. These values are then subtracted to calculate the time difference. The AVG function is used to calculate the average of all the time differences.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-545\" is explicitly mentioned in the query, indicating that the query is operating on that table. The column names \"end_time\" is also explicitly mentioned, indicating that the query is using that column to calculate the time differences.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))) \nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
