{"signal_description": "Calculate the sum of 'PO Amount Billed' for all rows in 'defaultview-431' where 'PO Item Line Type' is 'Catalog'. The result will be labeled as 'PO Spend on Catalog'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the sum of 'PO Amount Billed' for all rows in 'defaultview-431' where 'PO Item Line Type' is 'Catalog'. The result will be labeled as 'PO Spend on Catalog'.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed by selecting a single column, \"PO Amount Billed\", and applying a filter on another column, \"PO Item Line Type\", to only include rows where the value of \"PO Item Line Type\" is 'Catalog'. The filtered rows are then summarized using the SUM aggregation function, and the result is labeled as \"PO Spend on Catalog\".\n\nTo create the human-readable description, we first identify the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-431\", and the column names are \"PO Amount Billed\" and \"PO Item Line Type\". The value used in the filter is 'Catalog'.\n\nNext, we construct a natural language sentence that describes the purpose of the Signal query. We start by stating the goal of the query, which is to calculate the sum of \"PO Amount Billed\" for a specific set of rows. We then specify the filter condition, which is that \"PO Item Line Type\" must be 'Catalog'. Finally, we describe the result of the query, which is the calculated sum of \"PO Amount Billed\" for all rows that meet the filter condition, labeled as \"PO Spend on Catalog\".\n\nThe resulting human-readable description is: \"Calculate the sum of 'PO Amount Billed' for all rows in 'defaultview-431' where 'PO Item Line Type' is 'Catalog'. The result will be labeled as 'PO Spend on Catalog'.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nSUM (\"PO Amount Billed\") FILTER (WHERE \"PO Item Line Type\" = 'Catalog') AS \"PO Spend on Catalog\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
