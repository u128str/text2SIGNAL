Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Identifying the column names: CASE_ID, END_TIME, EVENT_NAME\n3. Understanding the logic of the query:\n\t* The query uses a subquery to select the last END_TIME for events with the name 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item'\n\t* The difference between the two END_TIMEs is calculated\n\t* The difference is compared to a duration of 3 days\n\t* If the difference is greater than 3 days, the CASE_ID is counted\n4.
