SELECT clause: The select clause retrieves two columns, \"Month\" and \"Average Cycle Time\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function: The DATE_TRUNC function is used to truncate the end time to the first day of the month. This is done by passing 'month' as the first argument and the SELECT FIRST(end_time) as the second argument.\n3. AVG function: The AVG function calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the FIRST(end_time) from the LAST(end_time) for each month.\n4. FROM clause: The FROM clause specifies the table to use for the query, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n5. ORDER BY clause: The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by the \"Month\" column in ascending order.\n6. NULLS FIRST: The NULLS FIRST clause specifies that null values should be treated as the lowest value in the column when sorting.\n7. FILL TIMESERIES function: The FILL TIMESERIES function fills in missing values in the timeseries with null values.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal query retrieves the average cycle time for each month, sorted in ascending order, with missing values filled in.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time))) AS Month,\n    \n    AVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))) AS \"Average Cycle Time\"\n    \nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
