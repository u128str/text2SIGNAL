This is used to group the data by month.\n* The second part of the query uses a subquery to retrieve the first `END_TIME` value for each case where the `EVENT_NAME` is 'Vendor Creates Invoice'. This subquery is used to calculate the cycle time for each case.\n* The third part of the query uses another subquery to retrieve the last `END_TIME` value for each case where the `EVENT_NAME` is 'Clear Invoice'. This subquery is used to calculate the cycle time for each case.\n* The fourth part of the query calculates the average cycle time for each month by taking the difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Vendor Creates Invoice' event for each case, and then averaging across all cases for a given month.\n* The final part of the query orders the results by the month column in ascending order, and fills in missing values in the time series using the `FILL` function.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.
