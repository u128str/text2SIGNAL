Identifying the column names: \"case_id\", \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\", and \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\"\n3. Understanding the filter condition: \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" IS NULL AND \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW())\n4. Breaking down the filter condition into its components:\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" IS NULL: This condition checks for the existence of a value in the \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" column.\n\t* AND \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()): This condition checks for the value in the \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" column and compares it to the current day, using the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the current date to the day level.\n5. Combining the components into a human-readable description: \"Count the number of case_id where Last Inv. Item Clearing Date is null and Last Inv.
