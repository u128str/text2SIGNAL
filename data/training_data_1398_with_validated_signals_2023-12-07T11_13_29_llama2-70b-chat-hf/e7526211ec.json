Creating a human-readable description that references the table, column names, and respective values:\n\t* Start with a brief statement of the query's purpose.\n\t* Reference the table name and column names explicitly.\n\t* Describe the filter condition in natural language, using the column name and the specific value(s) referenced in the query.\n\t* Use proper sentence structure and punctuation to make the description easy to understand.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it will be executed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\")\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE NOT event_name MATCHES('Material shortage') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
