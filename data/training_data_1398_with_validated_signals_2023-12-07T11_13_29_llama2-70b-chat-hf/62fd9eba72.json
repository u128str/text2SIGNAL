{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of distinct event names from the 'Flatten(\"defaultview-183\")' table, ordered descendingly by the count of event names.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the given SIGNAL query.\n\n1. First, we identified the table name, which is \"Flatten(\"defaultview-183\")\".\n2. Next, we identified the column names and their respective values used in the query. In this case, we have two columns: \"event_name\" and \"count(event_name)\". The value for \"event_name\" is not explicitly specified, which means it is a selection of all rows from the table. The value for \"count(event_name)\" is an aggregation function that counts the number of distinct values in the \"event_name\" column.\n3. We then constructed a human-readable description of the query by combining the information gathered in steps 1 and 2. We used natural language to explain the purpose of the query, including the table name, column names, and aggregation function used.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and results of the query without having to manually execute it.", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
