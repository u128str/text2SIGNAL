In this case, it is \"PO Date\", \"PO Material Group\", and \"Vendor Name\".\n* The fifth part of the query is an ORDER BY clause that specifies the columns to order the results by and the direction of the order. In this case, it is \"Total Purchase Amount (INR)\" in descending order and \"PO Date\" in descending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the selected columns, the table being queried, the filtering conditions, the partitioning columns, and the ordering columns.
