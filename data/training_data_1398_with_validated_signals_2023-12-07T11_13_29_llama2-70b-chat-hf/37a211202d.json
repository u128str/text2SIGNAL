{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of case IDs from the 'defaultview-217' table where the 'event_name' column matches the string 'Unflag Issue'.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of case IDs from the 'defaultview-217' table where the 'event_name' column matches the string 'Unflag Issue'.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query uses the SELECT statement to retrieve the count of case IDs from the \"defaultview-217\" table. The COUNT function is applied to the case_id column, and the FILTER clause is used to filter the results based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the event_name column must match the string 'Unflag Issue'.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the count of case IDs from the \"defaultview-217\" table.\n2. Filter the results to only include rows where the event_name column matches the string 'Unflag Issue'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should include the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query. In this case, the signal_description should mention the \"defaultview-217\" table, the case_id column, and the event_name column with the value 'Unflag Issue'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\ncount(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Unflag Issue'))\n-- / count(case_id)\n\nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
