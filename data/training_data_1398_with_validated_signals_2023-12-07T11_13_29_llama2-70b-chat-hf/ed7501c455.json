Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-383\".\n2. Identifying the column names and their respective values that are used in the SIGNAL query:\n\t* \"UniqueEventId\"\n\t* \"EventCreatedByUserType\"\n\t* \"event_name\"\n\t* \"ChangeType\"\n3. Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query uses the FILTER clause to filter the data based on the conditions specified in the BEHAVIOR function.\n\t* The BEHAVIOR function checks if the \"EventCreatedByUserType\" is in ('Dialog') and if the event name and change type match the specified conditions.\n\t* The query then calculates the percentage of unique event IDs that match the conditions by dividing the count of distinct \"UniqueEventId\" by the total count of distinct \"UniqueEventId\" and multiplying by 100.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It starts by stating the purpose of the query, which is to count the percentage of unique event IDs that meet certain conditions.\n\t* It then lists the conditions that must be met, including the event created by user type, event name, and change type.\n\t* It mentions the table name and column names where the data is coming from.\n\t* Finally, it states the formula used to calculate the percentage.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('Dialog')\n        AND (\n          event_name LIKE '%Quotation%'\n          AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n      ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") * 100\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\nWHERE\n  (\n    event_name LIKE '%Quotation%'\n    AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n  ) \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
