Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: AVG( )\n\t* The subqueries: (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Unflag Issue')) and (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Flag Issue'))\n\t* The FROM clause: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* The WHERE clause: event_name MATCHES ('Flag Issue' ~> 'Unflag Issue')\n2. Breaking down each subquery:\n\t* The first subquery: (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Unflag Issue'))\n\t\t+ The purpose of this subquery is to retrieve the first 'end_time' value for events with 'event_name' equal to 'Unflag Issue'\n\t\t+ The subquery uses the 'FIRST' aggregation function to retrieve the first row, and the 'WHERE' clause filters the results to only include rows with the specified 'event_name'\n\t* The second subquery: (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Flag Issue'))\n\t\t+ The purpose of this subquery is to retrieve the first 'end_time' value for events with 'event_name' equal to 'Flag Issue'\n\t\t+ The subquery uses the 'FIRST' aggregation function to retrieve the first row, and the 'WHERE' clause filters the results to only include rows with the specified 'event_name'\n3. Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query calculates the average time difference between when an issue is flagged and when it is unflagged\n\t* The query uses the subqueries to retrieve the first 'end_time' values for both 'Flag Issue' and 'Unflag Issue' events\n\t* The query then subtracts the 'end_time' value of the 'Flag Issue' event from the 'end_time' value of the 'Unflag Issue' event to get the time difference\n\t* The query uses the 'AVG' aggregation function to calculate the average time difference across all matching events\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description should provide a clear and concise explanation of what the SIGNAL query is doing\n\t* The description should include references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query\n\t* The description should be written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table schema and the data\n\nTherefore, the signal_description for this SIGNAL query would be: \"Calculate the average time difference between when an issue is flagged and when it is unflagged. The calculation is based on the 'end_time' column of the 'defaultview-217' table, where the 'event_name' column matches 'Flag Issue' followed by 'Unflag Issue'.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Unflag Issue'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Flag Issue'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Flag Issue' ~> 'Unflag Issue') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
