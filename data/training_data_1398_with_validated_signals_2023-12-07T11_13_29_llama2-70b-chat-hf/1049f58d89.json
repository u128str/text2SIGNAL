The first part of the query is SELECT, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. The next part is COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS \"# of SDs\", which tells us that we are counting the number of unique case IDs (which we can infer to be the number of sales documents (SDs)) and assigning the result to a column named \"# of SDs\".\n3. The following part is (COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) FILTER (WHERE BEHAVIOR ( \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('Dialog') AND ChangeType = 'Update' ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"case_id\") * 100 AS \"Change rate\", which is a bit more complex. It first filters the data to only include case IDs where the behavior matches a certain condition (i.e., the event was created by a user type of Dialog and the change type is Update). It then calculates the percentage of case IDs that match this condition by dividing the filtered count by the total count of case IDs and multiplying by 100. This tells us that we are calculating the change rate of SDs created with Dialog by user type.\n4. The final part of the query is \"SalesDocCustomerCountry\" AS \"SD Customer Country\", which tells us that we are selecting the customer country column from the SalesDoc table (which we can infer to be the table name) and assigning it the alias \"SD Customer Country\".\n5. The last part of the query is ORDER BY 1 DESC, which tells us that we are ordering the data by the first column (which we can infer to be the \"# of SDs\" column) in descending order.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the signal_description as \"Retrieve the number of sales documents (SDs) and the change rate of SDs created with Dialog by user type, and the customer country of SDs, from the 'defaultview-383' table, ordered by the number of SDs in descending order.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) AS \"# of SDs\",\n  (\n    COUNT(DISTINCT case_id) FILTER (\n      WHERE\n        BEHAVIOR (\n          \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('Dialog')\n          AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n        ) AS created_with_dialog MATCHES (created_with_dialog)\n    )\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"case_id\") * 100 AS \"Change rate\",\n  \"SalesDocCustomerCountry\" AS \"SD Customer Country\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\"\nORDER BY\n  1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
