First, we have a subquery that selects the last and first occurrence of events with more than one occurrence. This is done using the BOOL_OR function to check if the occurrence is greater than 1, and then selecting the last and first occurrence using the LAST and FIRST functions.\n2. Next, we filter the results to only include events with more than one occurrence using the FILTER function.\n3. Then, we calculate the average time difference between the last and first occurrence of these events using the AVG function.\n4. Finally, we subtract the average time difference of all events from the average time difference of events with more than one occurrence.\n\nWith this understanding, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that references the table name, column names, and respective values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(AVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))\n)\n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM(SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub)\n\t\t))\n-\n(AVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))\n))\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
