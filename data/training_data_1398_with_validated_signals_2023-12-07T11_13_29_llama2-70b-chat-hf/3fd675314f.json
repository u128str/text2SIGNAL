The subquery uses the SELECT statement to retrieve the count of events from the \"defaultview-217\" table where the event_name is 'Change Status to In Review'.\n* The result of the subquery is then used in the main query to calculate the average count of events.\n* The FILTER clause is used to filter out the results based on the condition that the ResolutionStatus is not null.\n* The query uses the FROM clause to specify the table name \"defaultview-217\" from which the data should be retrieved.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should accurately summarize the query and provide a clear understanding of what the query is trying to achieve.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG(\n\t(SELECT count(event_name) \n    WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Review')\n   )\nFILTER (WHERE \"ResolutionStatus\" IS NOT NULL) \nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
