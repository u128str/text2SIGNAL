The first part of the query is a SELECT statement that chooses the columns to include in the output. The first column is the average approval time, which is calculated later in the query. The second column is the company code, which is selected from the \"Project_CompanyCode\" column.\n2. The next part of the query is a FROM clause that specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, the table is \"defaultview-197\".\n3. The query then uses a CASE statement to calculate the average approval time for each timesheet record. The calculation involves taking the difference between the end time and the first end time of the 'Create Timesheet Record' event, and then filtering the results to only include records where the event name is either 'Approve Timesheet Record' or 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record'.\n4. The results of the calculation are then ordered by the calculated average approval time in descending order using the ORDER BY clause.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the query without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG(AVG_ApprovalTime) \n,\"Project_CompanyCode\"  AS \"Company Code\"\n\nFROM (\nSELECT case_id, \"Project_CompanyCode\" ,\nTimesheetRecord, \nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Timesheet Record') OVER (PARTITION BY TimesheetRecord ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ApprovalTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n)\nAS ApprovalTimeCalculation\nWHERE event_name IN ('Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record')\n\nORDER BY 1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
