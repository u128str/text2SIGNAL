Breaking down the SELECT clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* count(event_name): This part of the query calculates the count of the event_name column.\n\t* / 1000: This part divides the result of the count by 1000.\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* FLATTEN(\"defaultview-225\"): This is the table name.\n\t* event_name: This is the column name.\n4. Identifying the filter criteria:\n\t* event_name IN ('Change Invoice Due Date', 'Change Baseline Date'): This part of the query filters the rows based on the values in the event_name column.\n5.
