Breaking down the query into its main components, such as the table name, column names, and the conditions applied.\n3. Using natural language to describe each component, in a way that is easy to understand for a human reader.\n4. Combining the descriptions of each component into a single sentence, while ensuring that the sentence structure is clear and concise.\n5.
