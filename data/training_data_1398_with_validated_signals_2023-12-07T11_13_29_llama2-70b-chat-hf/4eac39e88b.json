In this case, we are selecting a single column, which is the result of a calculation.\n* Next, we have the calculation itself, which is enclosed in parentheses. The calculation involves subtracting the first end time of events named 'Post Invoice' from the last end time of events named 'Clear Invoice'. The events must have a user type of 'Dialog'.\n* The calculation is performed over a specific set of rows, which are defined by the WHERE clause. The rows must have a 'Last Payment Clearing Date' that is not null and a 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' that is greater than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date'.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be used for the calculation. In this case, the table is named \"defaultview-225\".\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that is easy to understand.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')\n\t\t\tAND \"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('Dialog')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice')\n          \tAND \"Event Created By User Type\" IN ('Dialog'))) \n        \nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \nWHERE 'Last Payment Clearing Date' IS NOT NULL\n    AND (\"Last Inv.
