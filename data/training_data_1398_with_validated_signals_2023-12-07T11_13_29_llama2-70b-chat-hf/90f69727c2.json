The query uses the FILTER clause to filter the data based on the EVENT_NAME column, selecting only rows where the EVENT_NAME is either 'Pay Invoice' or 'Create PR Item'.\n\nThe query then uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first END_TIME values for the filtered rows, respectively. The LAST function is used to retrieve the last END_TIME value for the 'Pay Invoice' events, while the FIRST function is used to retrieve the first END_TIME value for the 'Create PR Item' events.\n\nThe query then calculates the difference between the last 'Pay Invoice' END_TIME and the first 'Create PR Item' END_TIME for each process instance in the table. Finally, the AVG function is used to calculate the average of these differences, which is returned as the result of the query.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as a human-readable instruction, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.
