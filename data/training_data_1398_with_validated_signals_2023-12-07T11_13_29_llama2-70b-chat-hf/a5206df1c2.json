In this case, we are interested in the count of the \"case_id\" column.\n3. Then, we examined the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions for which rows to include in the result set. In this case, we are filtering for rows where \"Order Actual Start\" is not null and the difference between \"Order Actual Start\" and \"Order Scheduled Start\" is greater than 0 minutes.\n4. Finally, we combined the information from steps 2 and 3 to create the signal_description, which is a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.\n\nThe signal_description includes explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.
