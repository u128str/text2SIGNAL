The next part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, the table name is \"FLATTEN(\\\"defaultview-545\\\")\".\n3. The ORDER BY clause specifies that the results should be ordered by the count of events in descending order.\n\nBased on this analysis, we can construct the signal_description as a set of instructions that describe what the query does.
