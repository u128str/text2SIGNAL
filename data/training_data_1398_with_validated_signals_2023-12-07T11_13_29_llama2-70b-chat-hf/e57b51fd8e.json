The first column is aliased as \"Payment Term\", and the second column is aliased as \"No. of Invoices\".\n* The second part of the query specifies the table to use: \"defaultview-225\".\n* The third part of the query applies a filter, only selecting rows where the \"Last Inv. Item Terms of Payment Key\" column is not null.\n* The fourth part of the query groups the results by the \"Payment Term\" column.\n* The fifth part of the query orders the results by the \"No. of Invoices\" column in descending order.\n\nUsing this information, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that references the table name, column names, and respective values.
