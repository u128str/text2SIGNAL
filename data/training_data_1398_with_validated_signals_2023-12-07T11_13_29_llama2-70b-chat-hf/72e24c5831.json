Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: extracts the average of a specific column.\n\t* FROM clause: specifies the table to query.\n\t* WHERE clause: filters the rows based on a condition.\n2. Breaking down the query into its constituent parts:\n\t* SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ avg( ) calculates the average of the specified expression.\n\t\t+ \"Scheduled Finish Date\" - \"Actual Finish Date\" is the expression being averaged.\n\t* FROM clause:\n\t\t+ \"defaultview-183\" is the table being queried.\n\t* WHERE clause:\n\t\t+ \"Planned Order Number\" is null filters the rows where the planned order number is null.\n3. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a natural language description of the query's purpose.\n\t* Reference the table name and column names explicitly.\n\t* Use human-readable phrasing to describe the query's logic.\n\t* Use parentheses to group related parts of the query.\n\t* Use a consistent verb tense (e.g., present tense) to describe the query's actions.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it interacts with the data in the \"defaultview-183\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n\"Scheduled Finish Date\" - \"Actual Finish Date\" \n)\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWhere \"Planned Order Number\" is null \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
