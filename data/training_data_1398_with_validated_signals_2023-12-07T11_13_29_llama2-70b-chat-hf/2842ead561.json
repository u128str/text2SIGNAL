The first column is aliased as \"Invoice Payment Terms\".\n* The second line of the query uses the COUNT function to count the number of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" values.\n* The third and fourth lines of the query use the SUM function to sum up the \"Last Invoice Item Amount\" and \"Last Invoice Item Discount Amount\" columns, respectively.\n* The fifth line of the query uses the SUM function to sum up the \"PO Amount Discount\" column.\n* The final line of the query orders the results by the \"Number of Invoices\" column in descending order.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a set of instructions that summarize the main components of the SIGNAL query.
