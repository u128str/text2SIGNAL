In this case, we're only interested in the calculated difference between the end times of the two events.\n* Next, we have a subquery that calculates the average end time for 'Complete Supply Planning' events that have a step status of 'COMPLETED'. This subquery uses the FILTER clause to filter the events based on the event name and step status.\n* Then, we have another subquery that calculates the average end time for 'Start Supply Planning' events that have a step status of 'COMPLETED'. Again, the FILTER clause is used to filter the events based on the event name and step status.\n* The two subqueries are then subtracted from each other to give us the difference between the average end times of the two events.\n* Finally, the result is multiplied by 14 to give us the final output.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-404\" is used in the FROM clause to specify the table we want to query.
