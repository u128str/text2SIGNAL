{"signal_description": "Retrieve the number of cases (No. of Cases), PO Item Plant, and PO Type from the defaultview-124 table, order the results by No. of Cases in descending order.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the number of cases (No. of Cases), PO Item Plant, and PO Type from the defaultview-124 table, order the results by No. of Cases in descending order.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the given SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is SELECT, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* The next part is COUNT (\"CASE_ID\"), which tells us that we are counting the number of rows in the table where the CASE_ID column has a value. This is the first column in the SELECT clause, so it will be the first part of our signal_description.\n* The second part of the query is \"PO Item Plant\" AS \"PO Plant\", which tells us that we are selecting the value of the PO Item Plant column and assigning it the alias \"PO Plant\". This is the second column in the SELECT clause, so it will be the second part of our signal_description.\n* The third part of the query is \"PO Type\", which tells us that we are selecting the value of the PO Type column. This is the third column in the SELECT clause, so it will be the third part of our signal_description.\n* The final part of the query is FROM \"defaultview-124\", which tells us that we are selecting data from the defaultview-124 table. This information is not explicitly included in the signal_description, but it is implied by the mention of the column names.\n* The last part of the query is ORDER BY 1 DESC, which tells us that we are ordering the results by the first column (No. of Cases) in descending order. This information is included in the signal_description.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Retrieve the number of cases (No. of Cases), PO Item Plant, and PO Type from the defaultview-124 table, order the results by No. of Cases in descending order.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT (\"CASE_ID\") AS \"No. of Cases\", \n\"PO Item Plant\" AS \"PO Plant\",\n\"PO Type\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nORDER BY 1 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
