First, we identify the table name, which is \"defaultview-545\".\n2. We note that the query uses three columns: DATE_TRUNC, AVG, and \"PO Item Line Type\".\n3. We recognize that DATE_TRUNC is a function used to truncate a date to a specific interval, in this case, 'QUARTER'.\n4. We see that the argument for DATE_TRUNC is a subquery that selects the last END_TIME value.\n5. We then look at the AVG column, which calculates the average of a subquery that filters the END_TIME values based on the EVENT_NAME being 'Reconcile invoice' and subtracts the FIRST END_TIME value for the same query.\n6. Finally, we note that the last column is simply a string literal, \"PO Item Line Type\".\n7. With this information, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is: \"Retrieve the average cycle time for receiving and reconciling invoices in the last quarter, grouped by PO Item Line Type.\"\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the main objective of the query, which is to retrieve the average cycle time for receiving and reconciling invoices.\n2. Noting that the query is grouped by PO Item Line Type, which is specified in the last column.\n3. Mentioning that the time frame for the query is the last quarter, which is determined using the DATE_TRUNC function.\n4. Emphasizing that the average cycle time is calculated by subtracting the first END_TIME value from the last END_TIME value for the same query, and then taking the average of the resulting values.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and scope of the query without having to examine the actual query syntax.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDATE_TRUNC('QUARTER', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME))) AS \"Quarter\", \nAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Reconcile invoice') - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Receive invoice')) AS \"Avg.
