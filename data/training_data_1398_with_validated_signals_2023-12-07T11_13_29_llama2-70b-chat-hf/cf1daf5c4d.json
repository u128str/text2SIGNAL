{"signal_description": "Calculate the percentage of cases in Contract Preparation stage out of all cases, using data from the 'defaultview-197' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the percentage of cases in Contract Preparation stage out of all cases, using data from the 'defaultview-197' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using the following steps:\n\n1. The first part of the query is \"SELECT\", which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. The next part is \"(COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'Contract Preparation') / COUNT(case_id))\", which calculates the ratio of cases in the \"Contract Preparation\" stage to all cases. This is done by counting the number of case IDs (using the \"COUNT(case_id)\" function) that have a \"Project_StageText\" value of \"Contract Preparation\" (using the \"FILTER\" function with a WHERE clause) and dividing that by the total number of case IDs (using the \"COUNT(case_id)\" function again).\n3. The result of this calculation is then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n4. The final part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-197'\", which specifies the table to use for the data.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description can be summarized as \"Calculate the percentage of cases in Contract Preparation stage out of all cases, using data from the 'defaultview-197' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\n(\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE Project_StageText = 'Contract Preparation')\n/\nCOUNT(case_id)\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
