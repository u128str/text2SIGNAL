Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"#Process Orders\", \"Material ID\"\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-183\"\n\t* WHERE clause: EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Process Order')\n\t* GROUP BY clause: 2\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"#Process Orders\": This portion of the query calculates the number of unique case IDs.\n\t* \", \"Material ID\": This portion of the query selects the material ID column.\n3. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-183\"\n\t* Column names: CASE_ID, MATERIAL_ID, EVENT_NAME\n4. Constructing the human-readable description:\n\t* Start with a brief summary of the query's purpose: \"Retrieve the number of process orders created, grouped by material ID.\"\n\t* Explain the main components of the query:\n\t\t+ \"The query uses the 'defaultview-183' table\"\n\t\t+ \"Counts the number of unique case IDs\"\n\t\t+ \"Groups the results by the material ID column\"\n\t\t+ \"Filters for events named 'Create Process Order'\"\n\t* Use parentheses to clarify the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t\t+ \"CASE_ID (#Process Orders)\"\n\t\t+ \"MATERIAL_ID (Material ID)\"\n5. Formatting the description into a JSON object:\n\t* Wrap the description in curly braces { } to create a JSON object.\n\t* Use a key-value pair to store the signal_description, with the key being \"signal_description\" and the value being the human-readable description.\n\nThe resulting JSON object is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the number of process orders created, grouped by material ID. The query uses the 'defaultview-183' table, counts the number of unique case IDs, and groups the results by the material ID column.
