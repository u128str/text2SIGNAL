{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' values from the 'defaultview-545' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' values from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\") FROM \"defaultview-545\"` can be broken down into several parts:\n\n* `SELECT`: This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* `COUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\")`: This function counts the number of unique values in the \"Last Invoice Id\" column. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that each value is only counted once, even if there are multiple rows with the same value in the column.\n* `FROM \"defaultview-545\"`: This clause specifies the table from which we are selecting data. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-545\".\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight the main aspects of the query, which are:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n* The column name: \"Last Invoice Id\"\n* The aggregation function: COUNT(DISTINCT)\n* The purpose of the query: retrieving the count of distinct \"Last Invoice Id\" values.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining these aspects in a concise and human-readable format, resulting in the following text: \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id' values from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\")\nFROM \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
