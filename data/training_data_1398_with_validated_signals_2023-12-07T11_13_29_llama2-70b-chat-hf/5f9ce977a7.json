SELECT: The query starts by selecting two columns: count(event_name) and count(event_name) filtered by a condition.\n2. FILTER: The filter condition is described as \"Event Created By User Type\" NOT IN ('Dialog'). This means that the query is only considering events where the value in the \"Event Created By User Type\" column is not 'Dialog'.\n3.
