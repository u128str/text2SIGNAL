The COUNT function is then used to count the number of unique event IDs in the flattened data. The FILTER function is used to filter the data to only include rows where the event name contains the string 'Delivery' and the change type is 'Update'. The BEHAVIOR function is used to create a boolean value that indicates whether the event name and change type match the specified criteria. The MATCHES function is used to match the boolean value to the changed column in the data.\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the query into its component parts and describing each part in a human-readable format. The table name and column names are explicitly referenced in the description, along with the respective values that are used in the query. The description is written in a style that would be familiar to someone who knows the table schema and the data it contains.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE '%Delivery%'\n        AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n      ) AS changed MATCHES (changed)\n  )\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
