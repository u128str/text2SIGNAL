We have case_id, \"Last Inv. Item Terms of Payment Key\", \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\", \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\", \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\", \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage1\", \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage2\", and \"Last PO Net Payment Days\".\n* Next, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table name, \"defaultview-225\".\n* Then, we have the WHERE clause, which specifies the condition for which rows to include in the result set. The condition is that \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" must not be equal to zero and not equal to \"Last PO Net Payment Days\", if it's not null, otherwise, it should be equal to zero. This condition is described in a human-readable format, using words like \"not equal to zero\" and \"not equal to Last PO Net Payment Days\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing without having to read the actual query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT case_id, \n\"Last Inv.
