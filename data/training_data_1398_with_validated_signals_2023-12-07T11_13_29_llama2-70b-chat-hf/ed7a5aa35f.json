Breaking down the filter conditions into human-readable instructions:\n\t* Count the number of case_id where Inventory Target is 0.\n\t* Filter the results to only include rows where the month is greater than or equal to the current month.\n\t* Further filter the results to only include rows where the difference between the month and the current month is less than 320 days.\n5. Combining the instructions into a single human-readable description.\n\nNote: The description does not include the SELECT clause, as it is not necessary for understanding the signal.
