{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve count of distinct case_id and event_name from the 'defaultview-43' table, ordered descending by count of case_id.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the given SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* First, we identified the table name, which is \"defaultview-43\".\n* Next, we identified the column names and their respective values that are used in the query:\n\t+ count(case_id)\n\t+ event_name\n* We then constructed a human-readable description of the query, using the identified table and column names, and describing the purpose of the query.\n* Finally, we wrapped the description in JSON format, as per the expected output result.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. Identify the table name: \"defaultview-43\"\n2. Identify the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t+ count(case_id)\n\t+ event_name\n3. Construct a human-readable description of the query:\n\t+ Retrieve count of distinct case_id and event_name from the 'defaultview-43' table, ordered descending by count of case_id.\n4. Wrap the description in JSON format:\n\t+ {\n\t\t\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve count of distinct case_id and event_name from the 'defaultview-43' table, ordered descending by count of case_id.\"\n\t}\n\nThe resulting JSON output is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve count of distinct case_id and event_name from the 'defaultview-43' table, ordered descending by count of case_id.\"\n}", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
