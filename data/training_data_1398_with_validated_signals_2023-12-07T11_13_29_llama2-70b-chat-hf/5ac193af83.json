The query selects six columns:\n\n1. \"Last PO Vendor Name\"\n2. \"No. Invoices\" (calculated using COUNT(case_id))\n3. \"Immediate PT behavior\" (calculated using a CASE statement)\n4. \"Payment Terms better on PO\" (calculated using COUNT(case_id) with a FILTER clause)\n5. \"Immediate Payment Terms\" (calculated using COUNT(case_id) with a FILTER clause)\n6. \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\"\n\nThe query uses several aliases to make the column names more readable. The table name \"defaultview-225\" is not explicitly mentioned in the query, but it is the source of the data for the query.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the main aspects of the query:\n\n* Retrieve number of invoices\n* Retrieve immediate payment terms\n* Retrieve payment terms differences where PO is better\n* Filter out invoices with null or zero cash discount days\n* Sort the results by the last PO vendor name\n\nThe description is written in a human-readable format, with explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\"Last PO Vendor Name\",\ncount(case_id) AS \"No. Invoices\"\n,CASE \n\tWHEN \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0 THEN 'Immediate PT on PO'\n    WHEN \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\" != 0 AND \"Last Inv.
