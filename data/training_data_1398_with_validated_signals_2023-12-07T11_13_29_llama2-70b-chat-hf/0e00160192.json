In this case, the only column selected is the result of a subquery, which is a calculation of the difference between two dates.\n* The subquery is a SELECT statement that chooses the last \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" and the last \"Inv. Posting Document Date\" for each record in the \"defaultview-59\" table. The subquery uses the NOW() function to get the current date and time, and compares it to the end time of each record to filter out records that are older than 60 weeks.\n* The calculation in the subquery is a simple subtraction of the two dates, which gives the difference between the last clearing date and the last posting document date for each record.\n* The final step is to take the average of the differences for all records in the table, which is done using the AVG() function.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing and how it is filtering and calculating the data.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n    (SELECT LAST(\"Last Inv.
