{"signal_description": "Count the number of unique ARUniqueKey in the FLATTEN table, where event_name is 'Create Accounts Receivable', ClearingDate is null, and the difference between NOW() and DocumentDate is greater than 30 days.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count the number of unique ARUniqueKey in the FLATTEN table, where event_name is 'Create Accounts Receivable', ClearingDate is null, and the difference between NOW() and DocumentDate is greater than 30 days.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by:\n\n1. Identifying the table name, which is \"FLATTEN\" in this case.\n2. Identifying the column names used in the query: \"ARUniqueKey\", \"event_name\", \"ClearingDate\", \"DocumentDate\".\n3. Understanding the filter conditions:\n\t* \"event_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\" - This condition filters the rows where the value in the \"event_name\" column is equal to 'Create Accounts Receivable'.\n\t* \"ClearingDate IS NULL\" - This condition filters the rows where the value in the \"ClearingDate\" column is null.\n\t* \"(NOW()-DocumentDate)> DURATION '30day'\" - This condition filters the rows where the difference between the current date and time (NOW()) and the value in the \"DocumentDate\" column is greater than 30 days.\n4. Understanding the aggregation function:\n\t* \"COUNT(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\")\" - This function counts the number of unique values in the \"ARUniqueKey\" column.\n5. Combining the information from steps 3 and 4, we get the signal_description: \"Count the number of unique ARUniqueKey in the FLATTEN table, where event_name is 'Create Accounts Receivable', ClearingDate is null, and the difference between NOW() and DocumentDate is greater than 30 days.\"\n\nNote: The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, it's not a direct copy of the query, but rather a summary of what the query does, written in a way that a human can understand.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\" ) FILTER(\n\tWHERE\n    \tevent_name = 'Create Accounts Receivable'\n        AND ClearingDate IS NULL\n\t\tAND (NOW()-DocumentDate)> DURATION '30day'\n)\nFROM FLATTEN (\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
