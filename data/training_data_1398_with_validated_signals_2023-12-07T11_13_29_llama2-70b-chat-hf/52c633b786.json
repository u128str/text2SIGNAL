In this case, the condition is that the EVENT_NAME is in ('Pay Invoice')).\n* Following that, we have the LAST function, which tells us that we want to select the last value of the END_TIME column that matches the filter condition.\n* After that, we have another nested SELECT clause with a similar filter condition, but this time for events with names 'Receive Invoice'.\n* Finally, we have the FIRST function, which selects the first value of the END_TIME column that matches the filter condition.\n\nPutting it all together, we can see that the SIGNAL query is calculating the average of the difference between the last End Time of events with names 'Pay Invoice' and the first End Time of events with names 'Receive Invoice' in the 'defaultview-545' table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
