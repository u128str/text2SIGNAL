The filter clause is defined as a subquery that counts the number of event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' and filters out the results where this count is greater than 0.\n* The third part of the query uses another COUNT() function with a FILTER clause to count the number of case_id where the status was changed to 'In Progress' only once. The filter clause is defined as a subquery that counts the number of event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' and filters out the results where this count is greater than 1.\n* The fourth part of the query calculates the percentage of rework cases out of all cases with status changed to 'In Progress' by dividing the number of rework cases (i.e., cases where the status was changed to 'In Progress' more than once) by the total number of cases with status changed to 'In Progress' and multiplying the result by 100.\n* The final part of the query orders the results by the third column (i.e., the \"Count\" column) in descending order, then by the second column (i.e., the \"LastEpic\" column) in descending order, and limits the results to the top 20 rows.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components of the query and their relationships to each other.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"LastEpic\" ,\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\nWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) \nWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 0 ) as \"Count\",\n\nCOUNT(case_id) \nFILTER (\n\tWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) WHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 1 )\n/ COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\nWHERE (SELECT count(event_name) \n\nWHERE event_name = 'Change Status to In Progress' ) > 0 )\n* 100 as \"Rework\"\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nORDER BY 3 DESC, 2 DESC\nLIMIT 20 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
