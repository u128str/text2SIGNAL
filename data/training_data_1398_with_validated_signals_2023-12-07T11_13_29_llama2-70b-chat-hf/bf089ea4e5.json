SELECT: The query starts with the SELECT clause, which indicates that we are retrieving data from a table.\n2. COUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\"): The COUNT function is used to count the number of distinct values in the \"Last Invoice Id\" column. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each value is only counted once, even if there are multiple rows with the same value.\n3. FILTER: The FILTER clause is used to filter the data before applying the COUNT function.\n4. WHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL) : The first condition in the WHERE clause is that the \"Last Invoice Payment Date\" column must be null.\n5. AND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()) : The second condition in the WHERE clause is that the \"Last Invoice Due Date\" column must be less than the current day, truncated to the day level using the DATE_TRUNC function.\n6. FROM \"defaultview-545\" : The query is applied to the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get the overall description of the query, which is to retrieve the count of distinct last invoice IDs from the 'defaultview-545' table where the last invoice payment date is null and the last invoice due date is before the current day.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\") FILTER (\n    \tWHERE (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NULL) \n        \tAND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" < DATE_TRUNC('day', NOW()))\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
