The 'filter' function is used to filter the events based on their names. The '-' operator is used to subtract the first event time from the last event time, giving us the time difference between the two events. Finally, the 'avg' aggregate function is used to calculate the average of the time differences.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by explaining the query in a human-readable format, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Deletion Flag')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
