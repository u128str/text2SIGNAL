This is described in the signal_description as \"and the number of invoices with shorter payment terms\".\n* The third part of the query is \"FROM \"defaultview-225\"\", which is specifying the table to use for the query. This is not explicitly mentioned in the signal_description, but it is implied by the mention of the column names in the next part of the query.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"WHERE ((\"Last Inv.

This is described in the signal_description as \"Order the results by the invoice posting date in ascending order, with nulls first\".\n* The final part of the query is \"FILL timeseries('MONTH')\", which is filling in missing values in the timeseries for the month.
