The query uses the FILTER clause to filter the events based on their names and the \"Step Status\" column. The AVG function calculates the average end time for each event type, and the minus sign (-) operator subtracts the average end time of 'Start Demand Planning' from the average end time of 'Complete Demand Planning'. The result is then multiplied by 8 and 14 using the * operator.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Select the average end time of 'Complete Demand Planning' events.\n2. Select the average end time of 'Start Demand Planning' events.\n3. Subtract the average end time of 'Start Demand Planning' from the average end time of 'Complete Demand Planning'.\n4. Multiply the result by 8 and 14.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and human-readable description of the query, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(AVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Complete Demand Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\n-\nAVG ((SELECT AVG (END_TIME) FILTER (\n\tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Start Demand Planning')\n\tAND \"Step Status\" = 'COMPLETED')) \n)\n) *8*14\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
