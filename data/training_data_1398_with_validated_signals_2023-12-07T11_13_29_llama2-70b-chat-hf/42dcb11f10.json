This selects the column \"CASE_ID\" from the table \"defaultview-183\" and counts the number of unique values in that column. The resulting value is then aliased as \"# Process Orders\".\n* The second part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-183'\". This specifies the table to use for the query.\n* The third part of the query is \"GROUP BY 2\". This groups the results by the second column of the table, which is assumed to be the \"Profit Center\" column.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1 DESC\". This sorts the results in descending order based on the first column, which is the \"# Process Orders\" column.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"# Process Orders\", \"Profit Center\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nGROUP BY 2\norder by 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
