The \"FLATTEN\" function is used to flatten the table data into a 1D array, allowing for easier querying of the data.\n\nThe query then applies a filter using the \"WHERE\" clause, which only selects rows where the \"ChangeType\" column has the value 'Update'.\n\nFinally, the query uses the \"COUNT\" aggregation function, along with the \"DISTINCT\" keyword, to count the number of unique values in the \"UniqueEventId\" column.\n\nThe resulting query returns a single value, which is the count of unique event IDs in the table that have a change type of 'Update'.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by mentioning the table name, column names, and the filter condition, providing a clear and concise instruction for the user.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT (DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\")\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\nWHERE\n  ChangeType = 'Update' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
