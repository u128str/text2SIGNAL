In this case, we have two columns: \"count(case_id)\" and \"FILTER(Where 'Actual Release Date' - 'Scheduled Release Date' < DURATION '0seconds')\".\n* The \"count(case_id)\" column is a simple count of all the rows in the table where the \"case_id\" column is not null.\n* The \"FILTER(Where 'Actual Release Date' - 'Scheduled Release Date' < DURATION '0seconds')\" column filters the rows to only those where the difference between the \"Actual Release Date\" and \"Scheduled Release Date\" is less than 0 seconds.\n* The \"/\" operator is used to divide the two columns, giving us the percentage of rows that pass the filter.\n* Finally, the FROM clause specifies the table to use, which is \"defaultview-183\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Get the count of case_id where the Actual Release Date is less than the Scheduled Release Date by duration '0seconds' and then divide it by the total count of case_id, all from the 'defaultview-183' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id)FILTER(Where \"Actual Release Date\" - \"Scheduled Release Date\" < DURATION '0seconds')\n/\nCount(case_id)\n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\n\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
