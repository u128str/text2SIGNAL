Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-183\"\n2. Understanding the query structure:\n\t* The query selects the average of a subquery that calculates the time difference between two events.\n\t* The subquery filters the events based on their names and the process status.\n3. Breaking down the subquery:\n\t* The subquery selects the last 'Deletion Flag' event using the 'last' aggregation function and filters the events based on the 'Deletion Flag' name.\n\t* The subquery selects the first 'Create Process Order' event using the 'first' aggregation function and filters the events based on the 'Create Process Order' name.\n4. Identifying the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t* 'end_time' is used in the subqueries to select the timestamps of the events.\n\t* 'event_name' is used in the filters to select events based on their names.\n\t* 'Partially confirmed' is used in the filter to select processes with the specified status.\n5. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the query that explains the calculation and the filters applied.\n\t* The description includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description is written in a natural language style, as if a human explained the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n(Select last(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Deletion Flag')))\n-\n(Select first(end_time) Filter(\nWhere event_name IN ('Create Process Order')))\n) \nFILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Partially confirmed')) FROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
