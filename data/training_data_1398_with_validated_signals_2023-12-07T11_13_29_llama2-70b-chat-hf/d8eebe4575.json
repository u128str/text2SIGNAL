The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each unique value is only counted once.\n* FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\"): The query specifies that the data should be retrieved from the FLATTENed table named \"defaultview-197\". The FLATTEN function is used to flatten the data in the table into a single row per record, allowing us to access the individual columns.\n* WHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable': The query filters the data to only include records where the value in the \"event_name\" column is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as retrieving the count of distinct ARUniqueKey values from the FLATTENed table 'defaultview-197' where the event_name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT \"ARUniqueKey\"  ) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\nWHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
