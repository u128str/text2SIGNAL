Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The table name: \"defaultview-197\"\n\t* The column names: \"WBSE_ProjectType\", \"case_id\", \"end_time\", \"event_name\"\n\t* The aggregation functions: COUNT(DISTINCT case_id), AVG(\"Duration\"), MIN(\"Duration\"), MAX(\"Duration\")\n\t* The filter conditions: \"Duration\" IS NOT NULL, event_name = 'Close Project' or event_name = 'Start Project' or event_name = 'Project Planned End Date passed'\n\t* The sorting order: ORDER BY 2 DESC\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts and describing each part:\n\t* The subquery: SELECT ... FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n\t\t+ This part of the query selects data from the \"defaultview-197\" table and flattens it into a single row per case_id.\n\t* The calculation of the \"Duration\" column:\n\t\t+ This part of the query calculates the duration for each case_id by taking the difference between the end time of the 'Close Project' event and the start time of the 'Start Project' event, and then subtracting the difference between the end time of the 'Project Planned End Date passed' event and the start time of the 'Start Project' event.\n\t* The main query: SELECT ... FROM (subquery) AS selection\n\t\t+ This part of the query selects the desired columns from the subquery and filters out rows where the duration is null.\n\t* The aggregation and sorting:\n\t\t+ This part of the query applies aggregation functions to the selected columns and sorts the results by the number of projects in descending order.\n3.
