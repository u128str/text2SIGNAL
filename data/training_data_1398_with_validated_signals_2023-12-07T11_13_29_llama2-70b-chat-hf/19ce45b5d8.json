Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: Extracting specific columns and filtering rows based on conditions.\n\t* FROM clause: Specifying the table name.\n\t* GROUP BY clause: Grouping rows by a specific column.\n\t* ORDER BY clause: Sorting the results by a specific column.\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))): Extracting the month of the first 'end_time' for rows where the 'event_name' is in ('Create Issue').\n\t* COUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE event_name MATCHES('Create Issue' -> 'Change Status to To Do') ): Counting the number of rows where the 'event_name' matches 'Create Issue' and the 'status change event name' matches 'Change Status to To Do'.\n3. Identifying the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* Column names:\n\t\t+ end_time\n\t\t+ event_name\n\t\t+ case_id\n\t\t+ status_change_event_name\n4.
