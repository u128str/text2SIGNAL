SELECT: The query starts with a SELECT statement, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n2. AVG: The next part of the query is AVG, which stands for \"average.\" This tells us that we are calculating an average value for the selected data.\n3. (SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time)): This part of the query is a subquery that calculates the difference between the last and first end time of events. The subquery uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first end time values from the table.\n4. FILTER: The next part of the query is FILTER, which indicates that we are applying a filter to the data.\n5. WHERE: The filter is defined using a WHERE clause, which specifies that we want to exclude events with an event name of 'Clear Invoice'.\n6. (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))): This subquery retrieves the first event name for each row in the table and filters out rows where the event name is in ('Clear Invoice').\n7. FROM \"defaultview-59\": The final part of the query specifies the table from which we are selecting data, which is \"defaultview-59\".\n\nBased on this breakdown, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is: \"Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time of events with event name not in ('Clear Invoice') in the defaultview-59 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) - FIRST(end_time))) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))) IS NULL\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
