SELECT: The query starts by selecting a column from a table.\n2. AVG: The selected column is aggregated using the AVG function, which calculates the average value of the column.\n3. FROM: The query specifies a subquery that provides the data to be aggregated.\n4. (SELECT ...): The subquery selects data from a table, in this case, \"defaultview-197\".\n5. LAST(end_time) and FIRST(end_time): The subquery uses the LAST and FIRST aggregate functions to select the last and first end_time values for each case_id, respectively.\n6. FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Close Project' and WHERE event_name = 'Start Project'): The subquery filters the data to only include rows where the event_name is 'Close Project' or 'Start Project'.\n7. OVER (PARTITION BY case_id): The subquery partitions the data by case_id and applies the aggregation functions to each partition.\n8. AS \"Cycle Time\": The subquery assigns an alias, \"Cycle Time\", to the calculated column.\n9. cte: The subquery is assigned an alias, \"cte\", which is used in the outer query.\n\nThe signal_description explains the purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average Cycle Time for each case_id by subtracting the first end_time of 'Start Project' from the last end_time of 'Close Project' events. It also mentions the table used, \"defaultview-197\", and the column aliases, \"Cycle Time\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG (\"Cycle Time\") FROM\n\n\t(SELECT\n     \n     LAST(end_time) \n     FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Close Project') \n     OVER ( PARTITION  BY case_id)\n    \n    - FIRST(end_time) \n    FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Start Project')\n    OVER ( PARTITION  BY case_id)\n    AS \"Cycle Time\"\n    \n    FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\") \n    \n    )\n    as cte \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
