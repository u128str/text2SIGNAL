Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: avg(Scheduled Start Date - Actual Start Date)\n\t* FROM clause: defaultview-183\n\t* WHERE clause: Planned Order Number is not null and Scheduled Start Date - Actual Start Date > Duration '0days'\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* avg(): average function\n\t* Scheduled Start Date - Actual Start Date: expression subtracting Actual Start Date from Scheduled Start Date\n3. Identifying the table and column names used in the query:\n\t* defaultview-183: table name\n\t* Planned Order Number: column name\n\t* Scheduled Start Date: column name\n\t* Actual Start Date: column name\n4. Constructing the signal_description by combining the information gathered in steps 2 and 3, using a human-readable format that includes the table name, column names, and respective values:\n\t* \"Calculate the average difference between Scheduled Start Date and Actual Start Date for all rows in the defaultview-183 table where Planned Order Number is not null and the difference between Scheduled Start Date and Actual Start Date is greater than 0 days.\"\n\nThis signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and scope of the query without having to read the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT avg(\n\"Scheduled Start Date\" - \"Actual Start Date\" \n) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWhere \"Planned Order Number\" is not null\nand \"Scheduled Start Date\" - \"Actual Start Date\" > Duration '0days' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
