The first part of the query uses DATE_TRUNC to truncate the end time of the invoices to the first day of the month. This is done to group the invoices by month.\n2. The second part of the query uses COUNT and FILTER to count the number of invoices that have an event name of 'Post Invoice' and then filters out any invoices that do not have an event name of 'Post Invoice'.\n3. The third part of the query uses COUNT and FILTER again to count the number of invoices that have an event name that contains either 'Update' or 'Change' and then filters out any invoices that do not have an event name that contains either 'Update' or 'Change'.\n4. The fourth part of the query calculates the change rate by dividing the number of invoices that have an event name that contains either 'Update' or 'Change' by the total number of invoices for that month.\n5. The final part of the query orders the results by the first column in ascending order, with NULL values sorted first, and then fills any gaps in the data using TIMESERIES.\n\nThe signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and functionality of the query without having to read through the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'month',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Invoice Post Date\",\n  COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          BOOL_OR (\n            EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Update%'\n            OR EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Change%'\n          )\n      )\n  ) / COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS \"Change Rate\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE\n  event_name MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'),\n  NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
