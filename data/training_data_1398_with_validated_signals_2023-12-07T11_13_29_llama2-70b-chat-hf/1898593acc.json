The query selects the average of the time differences between two events, 'Receive Invoice' and 'Create PO Item', for each process instance in the 'defaultview-431' table.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. The first part of the query selects the last 'Receive Invoice' event for each process instance using the 'LAST' aggregation function and the 'FILTER' clause to filter for events with the name 'Receive Invoice'.\n2. The second part of the query selects the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance using the 'FIRST' aggregation function and the 'FILTER' clause to filter for events with the name 'Create PO Item'.\n3. The query then calculates the time difference between the last 'Receive Invoice' event and the first 'Create PO Item' event for each process instance.\n4. Finally, the query filters for process instances that have both 'Create PO Item' and 'Receive Invoice' events using the 'MATCHES' clause.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation performed and the tables and columns used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PO Item'))))      \nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Receive Invoice') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
