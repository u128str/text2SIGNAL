Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: AVG(expression)\n\t* The expression: (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready For Review')) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))\n\t* The FROM clause: \"defaultview-217\"\n\t* The WHERE clause: event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Progress' ~> 'Change Status to Ready For Review')\n2.

Identifying the column names and respective values used in the query:\n\t* end_time (column name)\n\t* 'Change Status to Ready For Review' and 'Change Status to In Progress' (values used in the event_name column)\n4. Constructing the signal_description by describing the calculation in a human-readable format, using the identified column names and values:\n\t* \"Calculate the average time difference between 'Change Status to Ready For Review' and 'Change Status to In Progress' events, using the 'end_time' column from the 'defaultview-217' table.\"\n\nThe signal_description is a JSON object with a single key, \"signal_description\", whose value is a string that summarizes the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready For Review'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))\n\t)\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to In Progress' ~> \n    \t\t\t\t\t\t 'Change Status to Ready For Review') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
