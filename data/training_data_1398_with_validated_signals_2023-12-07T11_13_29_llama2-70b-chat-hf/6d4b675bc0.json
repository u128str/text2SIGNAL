The filter is applied to the flattened table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using the following steps:\n\n1. The first line SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") specifies that we want to count the number of unique event IDs in the table.\n2. The FILTER clause is used to filter the data based on certain conditions. In this case, we are interested in events with the name containing the word 'Quotation' and the change type being 'Update'.\n3. The BEHAVIOR function is used to extract the changed fields from the event. The function takes two arguments: the event name and the change type.\n4. The MATCHES clause is used to filter the data based on the changed fields. In this case, we want to match only the events where the changed fields match the conditions specified in the BEHAVIOR function.\n5. The FROM clause specifies the table from which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-383\" table.\n6. The FLATTEN function is used to flatten the table, which allows us to access the nested data in the table.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as follows:\n\n* \"Counts the number of unique event IDs\" - This phrase indicates that the query is counting the number of unique event IDs in the table.\n* \"in the 'defaultview-383' table\" - This phrase specifies the table from which the data is being retrieved.\n* \"where the event name contains the word 'Quotation'\" - This phrase indicates that the query is filtering the data based on the event name, and only events with names containing the word 'Quotation' are being considered.\n* \"and the change type is 'Update'\" - This phrase indicates that the query is also filtering the data based on the change type, and only events with a change type of 'Update' are being considered.\n* \"The filter is applied to the flattened table\" - This phrase indicates that the filter is being applied to the flattened table, which allows us to access the nested data in the table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\" ) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE '%Quotation%'\n        AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n      ) AS changed MATCHES (changed)\n  ) AS \"# Changes\"\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
