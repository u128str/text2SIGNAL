SELECT clause: The query selects two columns, bucket_end and ClientCount, from an unspecified table.\n2. IF clause: The query uses an IF clause to compute the value of bucket_end. If bucket_id is greater than 20, then bucket_end is set to -1, otherwise, it is set to bucket_id multiplied by 50 plus 0.\n3. BUCKET clause: The query uses a BUCKET clause to group the data by bucket_id, with buckets of size 50 and a step size of 20.\n4. COUNT clause: The query uses a COUNT clause to count the number of distinct case_id's in the data.\n5. ORDER BY clause: The query sorts the data by bucket_end in ascending order.\n\nThe signal_description describes each part of the query in a human-readable format, using explicit references to the table name, column names, and respective values.
