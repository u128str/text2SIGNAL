{"signal_description": "Calculate the percentage of case IDs that have at least two occurrences of any event name, based on the 'defaultview-545' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the percentage of case IDs that have at least two occurrences of any event name, based on the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using a combination of SELECT, FILTER, and FROM clauses. The query first selects the count of case IDs using the COUNT() function and filters the result using a subquery that checks for the occurrence of events. The subquery uses the OCCURRENCE() function to count the number of occurrences of each event name, and then uses the BOOL_OR() function to check if any of the occurrences are greater than one. The filtered result is then divided by the total count of case IDs and multiplied by 100 to obtain the percentage.\n\nThe query refers to the \"defaultview-545\" table, which suggests that the data is stored in a table with that name. The query also references the \"event_name\" column, which is assumed to be a column in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description can be summarized as \"Calculate the percentage of case IDs that have at least two occurrences of any event name, based on the 'defaultview-545' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE\n\t(SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM(SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub\n)\n)/COUNT(case_id)*100\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
