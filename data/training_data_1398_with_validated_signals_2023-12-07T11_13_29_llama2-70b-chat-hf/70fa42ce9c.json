In this case, we want to count the number of case IDs that match certain criteria.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the output. In this case, we want to filter the rows where the actual delivery date is not null and the difference between the actual delivery date and scheduled finish date is zero days.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table that we want to query. In this case, we are querying a table called \"defaultview-183\".\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Get the count of case IDs where the actual delivery date is not null, and the difference between the actual delivery date and scheduled finish date is zero days, and then multiply the result by 100.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER( \n\tWHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" IS NOT NULL AND \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" = DURATION '0days'\n    )\n/\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER( \n\tWHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" IS NOT NULL) \n*100\nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
