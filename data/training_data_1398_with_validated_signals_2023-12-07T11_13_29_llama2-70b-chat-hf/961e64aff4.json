{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of case_id where ResolutionStatus is 'Done' from the defaultview-217 table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of case_id where ResolutionStatus is 'Done' from the defaultview-217 table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is \"SELECT count(case_id)\". This tells us that the query is selecting a count of a specific column, in this case, \"case_id\".\n* The next part of the query is \"FILTER (WHERE \"ResolutionStatus\" = 'Done')\". This tells us that the query is filtering the results to only include rows where the value in the \"ResolutionStatus\" column is 'Done'.\n* The final part of the query is \"FROM \"defaultview-217\"\". This tells us that the query is operating on the \"defaultview-217\" table.\n\nPutting all of this information together, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query as: \"Retrieve the count of case_id where ResolutionStatus is 'Done' from the defaultview-217 table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) \n\tFILTER (WHERE \"ResolutionStatus\" = 'Done') \nFROM \"defaultview-217\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
