The data is fetched from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by breaking down the SIGNAL query into its component parts and describing each part in a human-readable format.\n\n1. SELECT: The query starts by selecting two columns from the \"defaultview-545\" table: COUNT(case_id) and DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\").\n2. FILTER: The query then applies two filters to the data. The first filter is WHERE DATE_TRUNC('day', \"Last GR Creation Date\") > \"PO Requested Delivery Date\". This filter selects only the rows where the last GR creation date is after the requested delivery date. The second filter is WHERE \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'. This filter selects only the rows where the delivery status is 'Received'.\n3. COUNT: The query then calculates the count of case IDs that pass both filters by using the COUNT(case_id) function.\n4. FILTER: The query applies another filter to the data. This filter is WHERE \"PO Delivery Status\" = 'Received'. This filter selects only the rows where the delivery status is 'Received'.\n5. COUNT: The query calculates the total count of case IDs that have a delivery status of 'Received' by using the COUNT(case_id) function.\n6. * 100: The query then multiplies the count of case IDs that have a last GR creation date after the requested delivery date and a delivery status of 'Received' by 100. This gives us the percentage of received purchase order deliveries out of all purchase order deliveries.\n7.
