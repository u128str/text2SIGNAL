SELECT: The query starts by selecting data from the \"defaultview-404\" table.\n2. COUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\"): The query counts the number of unique Product IDs in the table.\n3. FILTER: The query filters the data to only include rows where the month is within the last 320 days. This is done by using two subqueries that check if the month is within the last 320 days for the receipts and projected stock columns, respectively.\n4. SUM(\"Receipts\"): The query sums up the receipts for the filtered rows.\n5. SUM(\"Projected Stock\"): The query sums up the projected stock for the filtered rows.\n6. COUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\"): The query counts the number of unique Product IDs in the filtered data.\n7. * 100: The query multiplies the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nThe signal_description explains each part of the query in a human-readable format, using the table and column names to provide context.
