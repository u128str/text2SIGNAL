The query also calculates the average total cycle time, number of invoices, and invoice amount in US dollars. Additionally, it filters out cases with no goods receipt and displays the late payment rate as a percentage.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe Signal query starts by selecting the following fields from the \"defaultview-133\" table:\n\n* CYCLE_TIME: The time difference between the last \"Create FI Invoice\" event and the last \"Create Goods Receipt\" event.\n* CASE_ID: A unique identifier for each case.\n* INV_CONVERTED_USD_AMOUNT: The amount of the invoice converted to US dollars.\n* LAST_INV_ITEM_DUE_DATE: The due date of the last invoice item.\n* LAST_INV_ITEM_CLEARING_DATE: The clearing date of the last invoice item.\n\nThe query then applies a series of filters and calculations to the selected fields:\n\n* It filters out cases where the last invoice clearing date is null, indicating that there is no invoice clearing data available.\n* It calculates the total cycle time by subtracting the last goods receipt date from the last invoice clearing date.\n* It calculates the average total cycle time by averaging the total cycle time values.\n* It calculates the number of invoices by counting the number of distinct case IDs.\n* It calculates the invoice amount in US dollars by summing up the inv. converted USD amount values.\n* It calculates the late payment rate by counting the number of cases where the last invoice item due date is before the last invoice item clearing date, and then dividing that number by the total number of cases. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n\nFinally, the query groups the results by the cycle time range and sequence number, and orders them by the sequence number. The output is a table with the following columns:\n\n* \"Goods Receipt to Invoice Receipt - Cycle Time Range\": The cycle time range for each case.\n* \"Avg. Total Cycle Time\": The average total cycle time for all cases in the same cycle time range.\n* \"No. of Invoices\": The number of invoices for all cases in the same cycle time range.\n* \"Invoice Amount in $\": The sum of the invoice amounts in US dollars for all cases in the same cycle time range.\n* \"Late Payment Rate in %\": The late payment rate as a percentage for all cases in the same cycle time range.\n\nThe expected output result is a JSON object with a single property, \"signal_description\", which contains a human-readable description of the Signal query.
