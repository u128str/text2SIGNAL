The first line of the query selects the \"Scheduled Start Hour\" by using the DATE_PART function to extract the hour from the \"Order Scheduled Start\" column.\n2. The second line calculates the \"Avg delay in order start\" by taking the average of the difference between the \"Order Actual Start\" and \"Order Scheduled Start\" columns.\n3. The third line filters the results to only include orders where the actual start time is not null or the difference between the actual and scheduled start times is greater than zero hours.\n4. The fourth line orders the results by the scheduled start hour.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query. It includes references to the table name (\"defaultview-270\"), column names (\"Order Scheduled Start\", \"Order Actual Start\"), and respective values (DATE_PART, AVG, DURATION '0hours').
