The first column gives us the total count of distinct Product IDs, while the second column gives us the count of distinct Product IDs that meet certain conditions.\n* The conditions are specified in the FILTER clause, which has two parts. The first part is a SELECT statement that checks if the sum of Receipts is zero for a given month. The second part is another SELECT statement that checks if the sum of Projected Stock is zero for the same month.\n* The months that are checked are determined by the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the current date to the first day of the month. The months that are checked are those that are greater than or equal to the current month and less than 320 days ago.\n* Finally, the two counts are divided to give a percentage, which is multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-404\" is not explicitly mentioned in the SIGNAL query, but it is implied because the query is selecting from that table. The column names that are used in the query are \"Product ID\", \"Receipts\", and \"Projected Stock\".", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE (\n\t\tSELECT SUM(\"Receipts\") = 0\n\t\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\t\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n\t\t)\n\n\tAND (\n\t\tSELECT SUM(\"Projected Stock\") = 0\n\t\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\t\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n\t)\n)\n/\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
