Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: Extracting the column names and their respective values.\n\t* FROM clause: Identifying the table name.\n\t* WHERE clause: Identifying the condition applied to the data.\n\t* ORDER BY clause: Identifying the column used for sorting and the direction.\n2. Building the human-readable description:\n\t* Using the information from the SELECT clause, we created a descriptive label for each column, such as \"Creation Date\" and \"# Receivables\".\n\t* Mentioning the table name, \"defaultview-222\", in the description.\n\t* Including the condition from the WHERE clause, \"EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Create Accounts Receivable'\".\n\t* Noting the sorting order from the ORDER BY clause, \"ORDER BY 1 ASC\".\n3. Formatting the description as a JSON object:\n\t* Wrapping the signal_description text in curly braces to create a JSON object.\n\nThe resulting JSON object contains the signal_description, which summarizes the SIGNAL query in a human-readable format, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it was constructed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT  \n\tDATE_TRUNC('Day', \"end_time\" )  AS \"Creation Date\" ,\n\tCOUNT (DISTINCT ARUniqueKey) as \"# Receivables\" \n   \n   FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\")\n \nWHERE EVENT_NAME LIKE 'Create Accounts Receivable' \nORDER BY 1 ASC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
