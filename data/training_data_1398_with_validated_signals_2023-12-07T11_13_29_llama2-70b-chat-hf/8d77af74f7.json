In this case, we want to count the number of case IDs that meet certain criteria, so we use the COUNT function with the case_id column.\n* Next, we have the Filter clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the output. In this case, we want to filter the rows based on three conditions:\n\t+ The difference between the Scheduled Release Date and Actual Release Date must be greater than 0 seconds.\n\t+ The Event Created By User Type must be 'Dialog'.\n\t+ The Event Name must be 'Released'.\n* We use the WHERE clause to specify these conditions.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table that we want to query. In this case, we want to query the FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\") table.\n* We also have a WHERE clause that filters the rows based on the Planned Order Number column. We want to only include rows where this column is not null.\n* The JSON output is constructed by combining the various parts of the signal_description into a single string, using the appropriate syntax for JSON.\n\nNote that the signal_description is not a direct copy of the SIGNAL query, but rather a human-readable summary of what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) Filter( \nWhere \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '0seconds' AND \"Event Created By User Type\" in ('Dialog') AND event_name = 'Released' )\n/\ncount(case_id) Filter(Where \"Scheduled Release Date\" - \"Actual Release Date\" > DURATION '0seconds' AND event_name = 'Released') *100\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" IS NOT NULL\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
