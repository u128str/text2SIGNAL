It selects the sum of a column named \"SLA Definition Count\" from a table named \"defaultview-370\".\n\nTo create the signal_description, we can simply break down the query into its constituent parts and describe what each part does.\n\n* \"SELECT\": This keyword indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* \"SUM\": This function calculates the sum of a column's values.\n* \"SLA Definition Count\": This is the name of the column whose sum we want to calculate.\n* \"FROM\": This keyword indicates that we are specifying the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n* \"defaultview-370\": This is the name of the table from which we want to retrieve data.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Retrieve the total number of SLA definitions from the 'defaultview-370' table.\"\n\nThis description explicitly references the table name, column name, and column value (in this case, the sum of the values in the \"SLA Definition Count\" column).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tSUM(\"SLA Definition Count\")\nFROM \"defaultview-370\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
