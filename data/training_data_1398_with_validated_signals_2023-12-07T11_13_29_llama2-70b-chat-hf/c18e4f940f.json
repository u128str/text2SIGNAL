Identifying the column names and their respective data types:\n\t* \"Inv. Company Code Text\" (string)\n\t* \"Inv. Converted USD Amount\" (numeric)\n\t* \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\" (string)\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Due Date\" (date)\n\t* \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\" (date)\n3. Understanding the query's logic:\n\t* The query selects three columns: \"Company Code\", \"Invoice Amount in $\", and \"No. of Invoices\"\n\t* The query filters the results to show only invoices with a clearing date after the item due date.\n\t* The query orders the results by the \"Invoice Amount in $\" column in descending order.\n4. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a brief description of the query's purpose: \"Retrieve the Company Code, Invoice Amount in $, and Number of Invoices from the 'defaultview-225' table.\"\n\t* Add a sentence describing the filter criteria: \"Filter the results to show only invoices with a clearing date after the item due date.\"\n\t* Add a sentence describing the sorting criteria: \"Order the results by the Invoice Amount in $ descending.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and logic.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Inv.
