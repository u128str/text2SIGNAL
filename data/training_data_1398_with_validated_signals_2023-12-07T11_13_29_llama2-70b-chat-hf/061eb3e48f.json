Identifying the table name, which is \"defaultview-217\".\n2. Understanding the query's logic:\n\t* The query uses a FILTER clause to filter the rows based on a condition.\n\t* The condition is that the difference between the first end_time of events with name 'Change Status to To Do' and the first end_time of events with name 'Create Issue' is greater than 30 days.\n\t* The query uses a subquery to retrieve the first end_time for each event name.\n\t* The subqueries are nested inside a COUNT aggregation function, which counts the number of case_id that match the filter condition.\n3. Breaking down the query into its main components:\n\t* The first component is the COUNT aggregation function, which counts the number of case_id.\n\t* The second component is the FILTER clause, which filters the rows based on the condition.\n\t* The third component is the subqueries, which retrieve the first end_time for each event name.\n4. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* The description should reference the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description should be written in a natural language style, as if a human explained the query.\n\t* The description should highlight the main components of the query, such as the COUNT aggregation function, the FILTER clause, and the subqueries.\n\nThe resulting signal_description is a concise and clear summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and logic.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \ncount(case_id) FILTER( WHERE\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))\n\t> DURATION '30days') \nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to In Progress') \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
