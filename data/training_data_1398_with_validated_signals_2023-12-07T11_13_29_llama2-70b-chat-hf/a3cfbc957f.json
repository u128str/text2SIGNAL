SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"PO Creation Date\" and \"Average cycle time\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"PO Creation Date\", is created using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the date to the first day of the month. The function takes two arguments: the first is the column to truncate, and the second is the truncation unit (in this case, 'month').\n3. FIRST and LAST functions:\nThe second column, \"Average cycle time\", is calculated by taking the difference between the last end time of 'Create FI Invoice' and the first end time of 'Create PO Item'. The FIRST and LAST functions are used to retrieve the first and last values of the respective event names.\n4. FILTER clause:\nThe data is filtered using the FILTER clause, which applies the conditions specified in the WHERE clause to the data. In this case, the data is filtered to only include rows where the event name is either 'Create PO Item' or 'Create FI Invoice'.\n5. WHERE clause:\nThe WHERE clause specifies that the data must be from the \"defaultview-124\" view, and that the event name must match either 'Create PO Item' or 'Create FI Invoice'.\n6. ORDER BY clause:\nThe data is ordered by the \"PO Creation Date\" column in ascending order, with null values placed first.\n7. TIMESERIES function:\nThe TIMESERIES function is used to fill in missing values in the data. In this case, it fills in missing values for each month.\n8. NULL clause:\nThe NULL clause specifies that null values should be placed first in the output.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that summarizes the purpose and logic of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"PO Creation Date\",\n    \n    AVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create FI Invoice')))\n   \t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create PO Item')))) AS \"Average cycle time\"\n    \nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE event_name MATCHES ('Create PO Item' 'Create FI Invoice')\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
