The first line selects two columns: \"Project\" and \"Avg Cycle Time\".\n2. The second line specifies the table to query, which is \"defaultview-197\".\n3. The third line uses a subquery to calculate the \"Cycle Time\" column. The subquery selects the last end time of events with the name 'Close Project' and subtracts the first end time of events with the name 'Start Project'.\n4. The fourth line groups the results by the \"Project\" column.\n5. The fifth line sorts the results in ascending order by the \"Avg Cycle Time\" column.\n6. The final line limits the results to the first 20 rows.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.
