SELECT: The query starts by selecting two columns from the \"defaultview-404\" table: COUNT(case_id) and DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()).\n2. FILTER: The query then applies two filters to the data. The first filter is WHERE (\"Inventory Target\" > \"Stock on Hand\"). This filter selects only the rows where the inventory target is greater than the stock on hand. The second filter is DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\". This filter selects only the rows where the current date is equal to the month.\n3. COUNT(case_id): The query then calculates the count of case IDs that pass both filters.\n4. FILTER: The query applies another filter to the data. This filter is DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\".\n5. COUNT(CASE_ID): The query calculates the total count of case IDs for the month.\n6. * 54: The query multiplies the ratio of inventory target to stock on hand by 54.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get the signal_description, which describes the calculation of the ratio of inventory target to stock on hand for the current month.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE (\"Inventory Target\" > \"Stock on Hand\") \n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n) * 54\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
