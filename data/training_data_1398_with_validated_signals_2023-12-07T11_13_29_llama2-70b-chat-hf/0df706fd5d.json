This is specified using the SELECT clause inside the FILTER() function.\n3. FROM clause: The query is applied to the \"defaultview-95\" table.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description describes the query as getting the count of distinct case IDs from the \"defaultview-95\" table where the count of events with the name 'Order: REL - Released' is less than 1.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) \n\t\tFILTER( WHERE(\n        \tSELECT count(event_name)\n            WHERE event_name = 'Order: REL - Released') < 1)\n\nFROM \"defaultview-95\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
