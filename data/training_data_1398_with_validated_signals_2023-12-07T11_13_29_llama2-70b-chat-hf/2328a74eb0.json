The first part of the query is the SELECT clause, which retrieves two columns: \"Invoice Clearing Date\" and \"Late payment rate\".\n2. The \"Invoice Clearing Date\" column is calculated by using the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the first end time of events with the name 'Clear Invoice' to the month level. This is done using the FIRST function, which returns the first value of the end time column for the events that match the name 'Clear Invoice'.\n3. The \"Late payment rate\" column is calculated by counting the number of cases where the invoice accounting clearing date is greater than the invoice due date. This is done using the COUNT function with a FILTER clause that selects only the rows where the count of events with the name 'Clear Invoice' is greater than 0. The result is then divided by the total number of cases, which is obtained using the COUNT function with a FILTER clause that selects all rows, and multiplied by 100.\n4. The query also includes a WHERE clause that filters the rows to only those where the event name matches the pattern 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'.\n5. Finally, the query includes an ORDER BY clause that sorts the results by the first column in ascending order, with NULL values sorted first.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components and calculations involved in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'month',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Clear Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Invoice Clearing Date\",\n  COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          COUNT(event_name)\n        WHERE\n          (\n            \"InvoiceAccountingClearingDate\" > \"InvoiceDueDate\"\n          )\n      ) > 0\n  ) / COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        SELECT\n          BOOL_OR(event_name IN ('Clear Invoice'))\n      )\n  ) * 100 AS \"Late payment rate\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-383\"\nWHERE\n  event_name MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'),\n  NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
