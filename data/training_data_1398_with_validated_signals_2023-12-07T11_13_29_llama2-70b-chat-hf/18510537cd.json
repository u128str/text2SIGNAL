The FILTER clause is used to filter the results to only include rows where the value in the 'Current Status category' column is not 'Done'.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identify the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-370\"\n* The column names: \"case_id\", \"Current Status category\"\n* The filter condition: \"Current Status category\" != 'Done'\n\nWe then construct the signal_description by combining these components into a human-readable description. We use a descriptive phrase for each component, such as \"retrieve the count of distinct case IDs\" for the SELECT statement, and \"from the 'defaultview-370' table\" to specify the table name. We also include the filter condition in the description, using a phrase such as \"where the value in the 'Current Status category' column is not 'Done'\".\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and what data it will return.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\ncount(\"case_id\") FILTER ( WHERE \"Current Status category\" != 'Done')\nFROM \"defaultview-370\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
