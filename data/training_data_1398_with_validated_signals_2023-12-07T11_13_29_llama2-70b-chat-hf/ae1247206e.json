Sort the results by the number of cases in descending order and limit the output to 25 rows.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is SELECT, which indicates that we are selecting data from a table.\n* The next part is COUNT(CASE_ID), which tells us that we are counting the number of rows in the table where the CASE_ID column has a value.\n* The AS keyword is used to give an alias to the column, in this case, \"No. of Cases\".\n* The next part is AVG ((SELECT LAST (\"end_time\") - FIRST (\"end_time\"))), which calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first end time from the last end time and then taking the average of the resulting values.\n* The AS keyword is used again to give an alias to the column, in this case, \"Avg. Cycle time\".\n* The next part is \"PO Item Line Type\", which tells us that we are selecting a column named PO Item Line Type from the table.\n* The FROM clause tells us that we are selecting data from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n* The ORDER BY clause sorts the results by the first column (No. of Cases) in descending order.\n* The LIMIT clause limits the number of rows returned to 25.\n\nPutting all of this information together, we get the signal_description: \"Retrieve the number of cases, average cycle time, and PO Item Line Type from the 'defaultview-545' table.
