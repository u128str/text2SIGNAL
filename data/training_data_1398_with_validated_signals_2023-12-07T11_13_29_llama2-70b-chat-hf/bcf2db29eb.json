In this case, the query selects the AVG function, which will be applied to a subquery.\n* The subquery is enclosed in parentheses and uses the SELECT statement to choose the LAST(end_time) column from the \"defaultview-217\" table. The subquery also includes a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include rows where the event_name column contains the value 'Change Status to To Do'.\n* The second part of the query is another subquery that uses the SELECT statement to choose the FIRST(end_time) column from the \"defaultview-217\" table. This subquery also includes a FILTER clause that filters the results to only include rows where the event_name column contains the value 'Create Issue'.\n* The final part of the query is the FROM clause, which specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, the query uses the \"defaultview-217\" table.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed as a human-readable description of the query. It includes references to the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query. The description is written in a style that would be familiar to someone who knows the table schema and the data it contains.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE (event_name IN ('Create Issue'))))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
