In this case, we have two columns:\n\n* count(1) - this is a count of all rows in the table.\n* count(distinct case_id) - this is a count of distinct case_id values in the table.\n\nWe can now construct the summary by describing what the query is doing with these columns. We're counting the number of rows and dividing it by the number of distinct case_id values.\n\nThe resulting summary is: \"Count of rows in FLATTEN('defaultview-9') divided by count of distinct case_id values.\"\n\nThis summary is written in a way that a human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values can understand what the query is doing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(1) / count(distinct case_id)\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-9\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
