The table name, column names, and respective values are explicitly referenced in the description.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. \"Retrieve the last inventory item vendor name\" - This part of the query retrieves the value of the \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Name\" column from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n2. \"count(case_id)\" - This part of the query retrieves the count of the \"case_id\" column from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n3. \"-- Invoice condition\" - This comment indicates that the following columns are related to invoice conditions.\n4. \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\", \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2\", \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" - These columns are related to invoice conditions and are retrieved from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n5. \"--PO condition\" - This comment indicates that the following columns are related to PO conditions.\n6. \"PO Terms of Payment Key\", \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\", \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 2\", \"PO Net Payment Days\", \"Last PO Net Payment Days\" - These columns are related to PO conditions and are retrieved from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n7. \"-- Inv vendor master data condition\" - This comment indicates that the following columns are related to inv vendor master data conditions.\n8. \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1\", \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2\", \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\" - These columns are related to inv vendor master data conditions and are retrieved from the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n9. \"-- Metric: Payment Terms Differences where PO is better\" - This comment indicates that the following calculation is a metric that compares payment terms differences between PO and invoice.\n10. \"COUNT(case_id) FILTER(WHERE (\"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\") < (CASE WHEN \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL THEN 0 ELSE \"Last PO Cash Discount Days 1\" END)) AS \"Payment Terms better on PO\" - This part of the query calculates the number of case IDs where the last inventory item cash discount days 1 is less than the last PO cash discount days 1, and stores the result in a metric called \"Payment Terms better on PO\".\n11. \"-- Metric: Immediate Payment Terms\" - This comment indicates that the following calculation is a metric that counts the number of case IDs with immediate payment terms.\n12. \"COUNT(case_id) FILTER(WHERE \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL OR \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0) AS \"Immediate Payment Terms\" - This part of the query calculates the number of case IDs where the last inventory item cash discount days 1 is null or zero, and stores the result in a metric called \"Immediate Payment Terms\".\n13. \"FROM \"defaultview-225\" - This part of the query specifies the table to retrieve data from.\n14. \"ORDER BY 1 desc\" - This part of the query sorts the results in descending order based on the first column.\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, explicitly referencing the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\"Last Inv.
