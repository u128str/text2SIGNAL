In this case, we have three conditions:\n\t+ NOW() - (SELECT LAST(end_time)) > DURATION '30days' - This condition checks if the current time is more than 30 days after the last end time.\n\t+ (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Clear Accounts Receivable'))) IS NULL - This condition checks if the first event name is null, and if it is not in the list of specified values.\n\t+ Project_StageText NOT IN ('Closed') - This condition checks if the project stage text is not in the list of specified values.\n* Finally, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table name \"defaultview-197\" as the source of the data.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"Count distinct case_id where the difference between the current time and the last end_time is greater than 30 days, and the first event name is null, and project stage text is not closed.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(DISTINCT case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE NOW() - (SELECT LAST(end_time)) > DURATION '30days'\n\t  AND (SELECT FIRST(event_name) FILTER (\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Clear Accounts Receivable'))) IS NULL\n\t\t  AND Project_StageText NOT IN ('Closed'))\nFROM \"defaultview-197\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
