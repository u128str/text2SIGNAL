The first part calculates the average time it takes to move from 'Create' to 'In Progress':\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue'))))\nThis part selects the last end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to In Progress' and filters out any events that do not have the name 'Create Issue' in the first column. Then, it calculates the average of the differences between the last end_time and the first end_time.\n\n2. The second part calculates the average time it takes to move from 'In Progress' to 'Ready for Review':\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review'))) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress'))))\nThis part selects the last end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to Ready for Review' and filters out any events that do not have the name 'Change Status to In Progress' in the first column. Then, it calculates the average of the differences between the last end_time and the first end_time.\n\n3. The third part calculates the average time it takes to move from 'Ready for Review' to 'In Review':\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review'))) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review'))))\nThis part selects the last end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to In Review' and filters out any events that do not have the name 'Change Status to Ready for Review' in the first column. Then, it calculates the average of the differences between the last end_time and the first end_time.\n\n4. The fourth part calculates the average time it takes to move from 'In Review' to 'Closed':\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed'))) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review'))))\nThis part selects the last end_time for events with the name 'Change Status to Closed' and filters out any events that do not have the name 'Change Status to In Review' in the first column. Then, it calculates the average of the differences between the last end_time and the first end_time.\n\nThe signal query then selects all the data from the \"defaultview-217\" table.\n\nThe signal description provides a summary of what the signal query is calculating, including the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Issue')))) AS \"Create => In Progress\",\n\n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Progress')))) AS \"In Progress => Ready for Review\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Ready for Review')))) AS \"Ready for Review => In Review\",\n        \n\tAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Closed')))\n    - (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to In Review')))) AS \"In Review => Closed\"\n\nFROM \"defaultview-217\"  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
