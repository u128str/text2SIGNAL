In this case, we are only selecting one column, `count(event_name)`.\n* `count(event_name)`: This is the aggregation function `count()` applied to the column `event_name`. This will return the number of distinct values in the `event_name` column.\n* `FROM`: This is the from clause, which specifies the table or view to be queried. In this case, we are querying a flattened view named `defaultview-59`.\n* `FLATTEN(\"defaultview-59\")`: This is the flattened view being queried. The `FLATTEN()` function is used to flatten a nested table or view into a flat table, allowing us to query the nested data as if it were a flat table.\n\nPutting it all together, the SIGNAL query is asking for the count of the number of events with the name `event_name` in the flattened view `defaultview-59`.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query as \"Counting the number of events with the name 'event_name' in the 'defaultview-59' flattened view.\" This description explicitly references the table name (`defaultview-59`), column name (`event_name`), and the aggregation function used (`count()`).", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(event_name) FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-59\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
