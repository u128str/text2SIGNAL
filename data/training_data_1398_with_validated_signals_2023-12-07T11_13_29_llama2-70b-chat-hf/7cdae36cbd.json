In this case, there is only one column, COUNT(case_id), which is filtered using a FILTER clause.\n* The FILTER clause specifies the conditions under which the COUNT(case_id) should be performed. In this case, the conditions are specified using a WHERE clause, which filters the events based on their names. The WHERE clause uses the MATCHES operator to specify a regular expression pattern that matches events with names starting with \"Create Invoice\", followed by \"Post Invoice\", \"Due Date passed\", and ending with \"Clear Invoice\".\n* Finally, we constructed the signal_description by describing the calculation performed by the SIGNAL query. We first described the COUNT(case_id) calculation, followed by the filter conditions, and finally the division by the total count of case_id and multiplication by 100.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and the data it is analyzing.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE event_name MATCHES('Create Invoice'~>'Post Invoice'~>'Due Date passed'~>'Clear Invoice'))\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
