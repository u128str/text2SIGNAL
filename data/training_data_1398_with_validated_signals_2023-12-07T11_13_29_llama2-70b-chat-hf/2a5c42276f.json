The query uses the 'FIRST' aggregation function to select the first event time for each group of events that have the same routing step and event name like 'Start%'. The 'WHERE' clause filters the events to only include those with the specified criteria.\n\nThe second query selects the first 'Complete%' event for each routing step, using the 'defaultview-270' table. The query uses the 'FIRST' aggregation function to select the first event time for each group of events that have the same routing step and event name like 'Complete%'. The 'WHERE' clause filters the events to only include those with the specified criteria.\n\nThe subtraction operation is performed by subtracting the first 'Complete%' event time from the first 'Start%' event time for each routing step. This gives us the time difference between the first 'Start%' and 'Complete%' events for each routing step.\n\nFinally, the 'AVG' aggregation function is used to calculate the average of the time differences for all routing steps. The result is a single value that represents the average time difference between the first 'Start%' and 'Complete%' events across all routing steps.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query by describing the calculation and the table and column names used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(\n\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tFILTER( WHERE event_name LIKE 'Start%' AND \"Routing Step\" ='0030'))\n- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n    \tFILTER( WHERE event_name LIKE 'Complete%' AND \"Routing Step\" ='0020'))\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-270\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
