The subquery calculates the number of cleared invoices, the total cleared amount, the late payment rate, average net payment terms, average payment time, and average paid late days.\n\nThe late payment rate is calculated by counting the number of invoices paid late, dividing that by the total number of invoices, and then multiplying by 100. The average net payment terms and average payment time are calculated by taking the average of the difference between the last invoice due date and the last invoice accounting date. The average paid late days are calculated by taking the average of the difference between the last invoice payment date and the last invoice due date, but only for invoices paid late.\n\nFinally, the results are sorted in descending order by the fifth and fourth columns.\n\nThe signal_description provides a concise and informative summary of the query, making it easier for users to understand what data is being selected and how it is being processed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n\"Company Code Name\",\n\"Vendor Name\",\n\"# Cleared Invoices\", \n\"Cleared Amount\",\nCASE\n    WHEN (avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1) >= 0.5 \n    THEN avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") - \n(avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1) + 1\n    ELSE avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") - \n(avg(\"Late Payment Rate %\") % 1)\nEND AS \"Late Payment Rate %\",\n\n\"AVG Net Payment Terms\",\n\"AVG Payment Time\",\n\"AVG Paid Late Days\"\n\nFROM (\nSELECT \n\"PO Item Supplier ID\"  AS \"Vendor Name\",\n\"Accounting Company Code\"  AS \"Company Code Name\",\nCOUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\"  ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' ) \nAs \"# Cleared Invoices\", \n\nSUM(\"Last Invoice Item Amount\"  )\nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' )\nAs \"Cleared Amount\",\n(\nCOUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\") \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' \nAND (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\"   - \"Last Invoice Due Date\")  > DURATION '1day')  \n/ COUNT (DISTINCT \"Last Invoice Id\") \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' ) \n) * 100\nAS \"Late Payment Rate %\",\n\nAVG (\"Last Invoice Due Date\" - \"Last Invoice Accounting Date\" ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' ) \nAs \"AVG Net Payment Terms\",\n\nAVG (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" - \"Last Invoice Accounting Date\" ) \nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' ) \nAs \"AVG Payment Time\",\nCASE \nWHEN AVG (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" - \"Last Invoice Due Date\") < DURATION '0day' \nTHEN NULL\nELSE\nAVG (\"Last Invoice Payment Date\" - \"Last Invoice Due Date\")\nFILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Pay Invoice' )\nEND AS \"AVG Paid Late Days\"\n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-545\")\nWHERE \"Last Invoice Payment Date\" IS NOT NULL\nAND \"Last Invoice Due Date\" IS NOT NULL\n) as selections\nORDER BY 5 DESC, 4 DESC \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
