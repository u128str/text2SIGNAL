Item Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL OR \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0\n4. Crafting the human-readable description:\n\t* Start with the phrase \"Retrieve distinct\" to indicate that the query selects distinct values.\n\t* Followed by the column name \"Last Inv. Item Terms of Payment Key\" to specify the column being selected.\n\t* From clause \"FROM defaultview-225\" is not explicitly mentioned in the description, but it's implied by the table name in the column name.\n\t* Then, the filter criteria are described using the phrase \"where\" followed by the two conditions connected by \"OR\": \n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" IS NULL\n\t\t+ \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" = 0\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a concise and clear summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nDISTINCT(\"Last Inv.
