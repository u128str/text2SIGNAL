Filters out invoices with null or zero cash discount percentages.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed by selecting columns from the \"defaultview-529\" table and grouping them by specific columns. The query uses the CASE statement to create a new column called \"SO Category\" based on the value of \"Last Inv. Item Sales Document\" and \"Last Inv. Item Clearing Date\". The query also uses filters to exclude invoices with null or zero cash discount percentages.\n\nThe query calculates several metrics, including the number of invoices, invoiced value in USD, early payment rate, number of paid early invoices, and invoice amount paid early in USD. The early payment rate is calculated by dividing the number of invoices paid early by the total number of invoices, and multiplying by 100.\n\nThe query is sorted by the \"Early Payment Rate\" column in descending order.\n\nThe signal_description summarizes the query instructions in a human-readable format, highlighting the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  \"Last Inv.
