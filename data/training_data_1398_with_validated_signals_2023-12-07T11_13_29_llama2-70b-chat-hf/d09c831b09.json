Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from a temporary table named temp.\n\t* The temporary table is created by selecting from a flattened view named \"defaultview-197\".\n\t* The selection includes case_id, ClearingJournalEntry, BillingDocument, event_name, and end_time.\n\t* The query applies a filter to only include rows where the event_name is 'Create Billing Document'.\n\t* The query calculates the AVG_ClearingTime by taking the average of the time differences between the 'Create Billing Document' and 'Clear Accounts Receivable' events, partitioned by billing document, and ordered by end time.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller, more manageable parts:\n\t* The first part of the query creates a temporary table named temp.\n\t* The second part of the query selects the AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) from the temporary table.\n\t* The third part of the query filters the results to only include rows where the event_name is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.\n3. Creating a human-readable description of the query:\n\t* The description starts by stating the main purpose of the query, which is to calculate the average clearing time for accounts receivable clearing journal entries.\n\t* The description then explains how the query does this, by taking the average of the time differences between the 'Create Billing Document' and 'Clear Accounts Receivable' events.\n\t* The description highlights the importance of partitioning the results by billing document and ordering them by end time.\n\t* The description concludes by stating the final result of the query, which is the average clearing time for accounts receivable clearing journal entries.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining the information from the three parts of the query and presenting it in a human-readable format. The description is written in a way that a person who knows the table name, column schema, and respective values can understand the purpose and logic of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT AVG(AVG_ClearingTime) FROM (\nSELECT case_id, \nClearingJournalEntry, \nBillingDocument,\nevent_name, \nend_time - FIRST(end_time) FILTER (WHERE event_name = 'Create Billing Document') OVER (PARTITION BY BillingDocument ORDER BY end_time)\nAS AVG_ClearingTime\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-197\")\n)\nAS temp\nWHERE event_name = 'Clear Accounts Receivable' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
