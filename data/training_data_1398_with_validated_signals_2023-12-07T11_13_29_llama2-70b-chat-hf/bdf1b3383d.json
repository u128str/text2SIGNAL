FILTER clause: We are filtering the count of \"case_id\" using a subquery that checks for the occurrence of any event name.\n3. Subquery: We are selecting the occurrence of event names using the \"OCCURRENCE\" function.\n4. BOOL_OR clause: We are checking if the occurrence of any event name is greater than 1 using the \"BOOL_OR\" function.\n5. COUNT clause: We are counting the number of case IDs that pass the filter.\n6. Division and multiplication: We are dividing the counted value by the total count of case IDs and multiplying the result by 100 to get the percentage.\n\nBy combining these steps, we get the signal_description that accurately summarizes the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (WHERE\n\t(SELECT BOOL_OR (occurrence > 1)\n\t\tFROM(SELECT OCCURRENCE(event_name) AS occurrence) AS sub\n)\n)/COUNT(case_id)*100\nFROM \"defaultview-59\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
