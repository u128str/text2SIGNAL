SELECT clause:\n\t* COUNT(\"case_id\") AS \"No of PO Items\": This part of the query counts the number of unique \"case_id\" values in the table and assigns the result to a column named \"No of PO Items\".\n\t* AVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create PR Item')))) AS \"AVG Cycle Time\": This part of the query calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first END_TIME of 'Create PR Item' events from the last END_TIME of 'Pay Invoice' events. The events are filtered by their names, and the difference is calculated for each row. The result is then averaged across all rows.\n\t* \"PO Purchasing Group\": This part of the query simply selects the \"PO Purchasing Group\" column from the table.\n2. FROM clause:\n\t* \"defaultview-431\": This part of the query specifies the table to use for the query.\n3. WHERE clause:\n\t* EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create PR Item' ~> 'Pay Invoice'): This part of the query filters the events to only those where the EVENT_NAME column matches either 'Create PR Item' or 'Pay Invoice'. The '~>' symbol indicates a regular expression match, which allows the query to match both 'Create PR Item' and 'Pay Invoice' events.\n4. ORDER BY clause:\n\t* 1 DESC NULLS LAST: This part of the query orders the results by the first column (which contains the count of \"case_id\" values) in descending order (DESC). Null values are placed last.\n5. LIMIT clause:\n\t* LIMIT 10: This part of the query limits the number of rows returned to 10.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query's purpose and the data it retrieves from the \"defaultview-431\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tCOUNT(\"case_id\") AS \"No of.
