This selects the column CASE_ID from the table and counts the number of unique values in that column. The COUNT function is used with the column name enclosed in parentheses, which is a common syntax in SQL and SIGNAL. The alias \"# Process Orders\" is also specified for the column, which is a human-readable description of the data that will be displayed in the query results.\n* The second part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-183'\". This specifies the table to use for the query. The table name is enclosed in single quotes, which is the standard way to specify a table name in SIGNAL.\n* The third part of the query is \"GROUP BY 2\". This groups the data by the second column of the table, which is assumed to be the role column based on the context of the query. The number 2 refers to the second column of the table, and the GROUP BY clause is used to group the data by that column.\n* The fourth part of the query is \"ORDER BY 1 DESC\". This sorts the data in descending order based on the first column, which is assumed to be the count of CASE_IDs. The number 1 refers to the first column of the table, and the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the data by that column.\n\nBased on this analysis, the signal_description was constructed to provide a human-readable summary of the query. It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query, along with a brief description of the data that will be displayed in the query results.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) AS \"# Process Orders\", \"Production Scheduler\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nGROUP BY 2\norder by 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
