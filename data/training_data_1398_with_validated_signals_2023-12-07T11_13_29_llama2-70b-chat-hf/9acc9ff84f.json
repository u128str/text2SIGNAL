This is done using the LAST function with a filter clause that selects only events with the specified name.\n* The second part of the query selects the first 'END_TIME' for events with the name 'Create Invoice'. This is done using the FIRST function with a filter clause that selects only events with the specified name.\n* The third part of the query calculates the difference between the two times for each invoice. This is done by subtracting the 'END_TIME' of the 'Create Invoice' event from the 'END_TIME' of the 'Due Date passed' event.\n* The final part of the query calculates the average of the differences across all invoices.
