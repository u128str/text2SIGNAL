The filter is applied to the flattened table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query starts by selecting the COUNT of DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\" from the \"defaultview-383\" table. The COUNT is filtered using the FILTER clause, which applies a condition to the data before the aggregation is performed.\n\nInside the FILTER clause, we have the BEHAVIOR function, which is used to define a pattern that matches events with a specific name and change type. The pattern is defined using a LIKE clause for the event name and a comparison operator for the change type. The BEHAVIOR function returns a table that contains the matching events.\n\nThe MATCHES clause is used to apply the pattern to the data in the \"defaultview-383\" table. The changed column is referenced in the MATCHES clause to indicate that the pattern should be applied to the changed values in the table.\n\nFinally, the AS clause gives an alias to the filtered count, which is \"# Changes\".\n\nTo summarize the query, we need to identify the main components of the query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-383\"\n* The column names: \"UniqueEventId\", \"event_name\", \"ChangeType\"\n* The filter condition: event name contains the string 'Invoice' and change type is 'Update'\n* The aggregation function: COUNT(DISTINCT)\n\nWith this information, we can construct the signal_description as a set of instructions that explain what the query does.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        event_name LIKE '%Invoice%'\n        AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n      ) AS changed MATCHES (changed)\n  ) AS \"# Changes\"\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
