Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a brief description of the query's purpose: \"Retrieve the percentage of PO items with total invoiced net amount equal to the net order value\"\n\t* Add a filtered clause: \"filtered by PO item total invoiced net amount document currency being equal to PO item net order value\"\n\t* Mention the table and column references: \"from the defaultview-57 table\"\n\t* Add the calculation: \"COUNT(case_id) / COUNT(case_id) * 100\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it was constructed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE (\"PO Item Net Order Value\" = \"PO Item Total Invoiced Net Amount Document Curr.\")\n    )\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
