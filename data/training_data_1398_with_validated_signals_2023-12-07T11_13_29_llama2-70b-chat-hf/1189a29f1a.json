First, we extract the date truncated to the month from the first row of the table using the DATE_TRUNC function.\n2. Next, we count the number of case IDs that have at least one 'DeliveryGoodsMovementOnTime' event using a COUNT function with a FILTER clause.\n3. We then divide the number of case IDs with at least one 'DeliveryGoodsMovementOnTime' event by the total number of case IDs using a second COUNT function with a FILTER clause.\n4. We multiply the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n5. Finally, we order the results by month in ascending order using the ORDER BY clause, and fill in any missing months with null values using the FILL TIMESERIES function.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-290\" is used throughout the query, and the column names used are \"end_time\", \"CASE_ID\", \"EVENT_NAME\", and \"BOOL_OR\".
