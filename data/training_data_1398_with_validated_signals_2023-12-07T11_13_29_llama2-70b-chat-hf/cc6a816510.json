The parts are then combined into a single description that explains the overall purpose and operation of the query.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. First, the query is read and the table name, column names, and respective values are identified.\n2. The purpose of the query is determined by analyzing the SELECT clause, which indicates that the query is intended to retrieve the average time taken to progress from 'Create Issue' to 'In Progress' for each month.\n3. The calculation is explained by breaking down the SELECT clause into its component parts. The first part is the calculation of the difference between the first 'End Time' of 'Create Issue' and the first 'End Time' of 'Change Status to In Progress' for each month. This is done using the SUBTRACT function.\n4. The second part of the SELECT clause is the averaging of the differences calculated in step 3. This is done using the AVG function.\n5. The FROM clause is then analyzed to determine the table name and any conditions applied to the data. In this case, the table name is 'defaultview-217' and the condition is that the 'Event Name' must match the pattern ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to In Progress').\n6. The ORDER BY clause is analyzed to determine the sorting order of the results. In this case, the results are sorted by the first column (which corresponds to the month) in ascending order, with null values sorted first.\n7. Finally, the FILL function is used to fill in missing months with null values.\n\nBy combining these parts, a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query can be constructed, which explains the purpose and operation of the query in a clear and concise manner.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST (end_time))) AS \"Month\", \nAVG ((SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Change Status to In Progress')) - (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Create Issue')))\nas \"Taking to Progress\" FROM \"defaultview-217\"\nWHERE EVENT_NAME MATCHES ('Create Issue' ~> 'Change Status to In Progress')\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL timeseries('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
