In this case, we're only interested in COUNT(CASE_ID).\n* Next, we have a FILTER clause that specifies the conditions under which the COUNT(CASE_ID) should be performed. The conditions are:\n\t+ \"Inventory Target\" > 0\n\t+ \"Stock on Hand\" > \"Inventory Target\"\n\t+ DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n* The second FILTER clause is used to calculate the denominator for the calculation. It filters the rows where the DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n* Finally, we have a FROM clause that specifies the table to use for the query, which is \"defaultview-404\".\n\nPutting it all together, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the key columns and conditions used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"Inventory Target\" > 0 \n\tAND \"Stock on Hand\" > \"Inventory Target\"\t\n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n) * 54\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
