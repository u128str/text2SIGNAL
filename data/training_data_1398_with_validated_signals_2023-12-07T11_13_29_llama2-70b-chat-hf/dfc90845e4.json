Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: AVG (expression) AS PaymentTime\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-545\"\n2. Breaking down the expression in the SELECT clause:\n\t* First, we extract the subqueries:\n\t\t+ SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))\n\t\t+ SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (WHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice'))\n\t* Then, we identify the column names and respective values used in the subqueries:\n\t\t+ END_TIME\n\t\t+ EVENT_NAME\n\t\t+ 'Pay Invoice'\n\t\t+ 'Receive Invoice'\n3. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* We start by describing the calculation performed in the query: \"Calculate the average payment time for invoices.\"\n\t* Next, we explain how the calculation is done: \"The calculation is done by subtracting the last end time of an event named 'Receive Invoice' from the first end time of an event named 'Pay Invoice'.\"\n\t* Finally, we mention the table name and the column names used in the query: \"The events are selected from the 'defaultview-545' table.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  AVG (\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS PaymentTime\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-545\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
