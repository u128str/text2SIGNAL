Cycle Time'\": This part of the query calculates the average value of a expression, which is enclosed in parentheses. The expression is a subtraction of two values, both of which are obtained by selecting the 'end_time' column from the table, but with different conditions on the 'event_name' column. The first value is obtained by selecting the first 'end_time' where 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Backlog', and the second value is obtained by selecting the first 'end_time' where 'event_name' is 'Change Status to To Do'. The resulting difference is then averaged and assigned the alias 'Avg. Cycle Time'.\n* \"FROM 'defaultview-217'\": This part of the query specifies the table to use for the query. In this case, the table name is 'defaultview-217'.\n* \"WHERE event_name MATCHES ('Change Status to Backlog' ~> 'Change Status to To Do')\": This part of the query specifies a condition on the 'event_name' column. The condition is a regular expression match, where the value in the 'event_name' column must match the pattern 'Change Status to Backlog' followed by 'Change Status to To Do'. The '~>' symbol is used to indicate a regular expression match.\n* \"ORDER By 2 DESC LIMIT 5\": This part of the query sorts the results in descending order based on the second column (which is the 'Avg. Cycle Time' column) and limits the number of results to 5.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT case_id AS \"CaseId\",\nAVG(\n\t\t(SELECT FIRST(end_time) \n\t \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to Backlog'))\n    - \t(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n       \tWHERE event_name IN ('Change Status to To Do'))\n\t) AS \"Avg.
