SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Invoice posting date\" and \"Rate (%) of Invoices with immediate payment terms\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"Invoice posting date\", is constructed using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates a date to a specific unit of time (in this case, months). The date used is the last END_TIME of all events with the name \"Post Invoice\".\n3. COUNT and FILTER clauses:\nThe second column, \"Rate (%) of Invoices with immediate payment terms\", is calculated by counting the number of case IDs that have a specific condition (either \"Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1\" is null or its value is 0) and dividing that by the total count of case IDs. This ratio is then multiplied by 100.\n4. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the table \"defaultview-225\".\n5. ORDER BY clause:\nThe results are sorted by the \"Invoice posting date\" column in ascending order, with null values appearing first.\n6. FILL timeseries function:\nThe query uses the FILL timeseries function to fill in missing values in the resulting time series.\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a concise and human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT DATE_TRUNC('MONTH', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME)FILTER(\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Post Invoice')) AS \"Month\")) AS \"Invoice posting date\", \nCOUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\nWHERE \"Last Inv.
