Breaking down the SELECT clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* \"SUM\" is an aggregation function that calculates the sum of a column.\n\t* \"PO Amount Billed\" is the column being summed.\n3. Breaking down the FILTER clause into its constituent parts:\n\t* \"WHERE\" introduces the filter condition.\n\t* \"PO Item Line Type\" is the column being filtered.\n\t* \"='NonCatalog'\" is the filter condition.\n4. Identifying the table name and column names:\n\t* Table name: \"defaultview-431\"\n\t* Column names: \"PO Amount Billed\", \"PO Item Line Type\"\n5. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* Start with a natural language description of the calculation: \"Calculate the sum of 'PO Amount Billed' for all rows in 'defaultview-431' where 'PO Item Line Type' is 'NonCatalog'.\"\n\t* Label the result: \"The result will be labeled as 'PO Spend on NonCatalog'.\"\n\nThe signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query, highlighting the main components of the query, such as the table name, column names, and filter conditions.
