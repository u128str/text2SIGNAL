Understanding the logic of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query calculates the percentage of cases where the last inventory item cash discount days are null or zero, out of all cases.\n\t* The COUNT() function counts the number of cases that match the filter condition.\n\t* The FILTER() function filters cases where the last inventory item cash discount days are null or zero.\n\t* The result is then divided by the total number of cases to get the percentage.\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* It also includes a brief description of the logic of the query, including any filters or calculations performed.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed in a way that a human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values can understand the query and its purpose.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER ( WHERE \"Last Inv.
