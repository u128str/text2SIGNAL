SELECT clause: The query starts by selecting the COUNT function, which will count the number of events that match the filter condition.\n2. COUNT clause: The COUNT function is applied to the event_name column.\n3. FILTER clause: The FILTER clause is used to filter the events that have the name 'Confirmed'. The MATCHES operator is used to match the event_name column with the specified pattern.\n4.
