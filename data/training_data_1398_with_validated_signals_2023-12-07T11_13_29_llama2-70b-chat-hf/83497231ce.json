Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query is selecting two columns from a subquery, which is defined as \"SUB\".\n\t* The subquery is counting the number of cases where the release PO was created 3 days after the create PO item, and the total number of cases.\n\t* The query is then calculating the percentage of cases that were released 3 days later, out of the total number of cases.\n2. Breaking down the subquery:\n\t* The subquery is selecting the LAST(END_TIME) where the event name is 'Release PO', and the FIRST(END_TIME) where the event name is 'Create PO Item'.\n\t* The subquery is then calculating the difference between the two times, and checking if the difference is greater than 3 days.\n\t* If the difference is greater than 3 days, then the CASE_ID is returned, otherwise NULL is returned.\n3. Identifying the table and column names:\n\t* The subquery is selecting from the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n\t* The columns selected are CASE_ID, END_TIME, EVENT_NAME.\n4. Constructing the signal_description:\n\t* The signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query.\n\t* It includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the Signal query.\n\t* It is written in a style that looks like a set of instructions written by a human who knows the table name, columns schema, and respective values.\n\nThe signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of what the SIGNAL query is doing, making it easier for users to understand the query and its purpose.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(\"Released 3 Days Later\"/\"Total No. of Cases\") * 100\nFROM\n(\n SELECT \n COUNT(CASE_ID) AS \"Total No. of Cases\",\n COUNT(CASE \n        WHEN (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item') > DURATION '3DAYS'\n        THEN CASE_ID\n        ELSE NULL\n       END) AS \"Released 3 Days Later\"\n FROM \"defaultview-124\"\n) AS SUB\n \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
