This part is describing the first filter clause, which counts the distinct 'SalesDocument' rows where the 'event_name' column contains a value that starts with 'Reject Billing Request'.\n* The second part of the query is \"COUNT(DISTINCT 'SalesDocument') FILTER (WHERE event_name ='Create Billing Request (DMR)')\".
