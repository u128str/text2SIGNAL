Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: COUNT (CASE_ID), \"Division\"\n\t* FROM clause: \"defaultview-183\"\n\t* WHERE clause: \"Actual Finish Date\" = \"Scheduled Finish Date\" AND \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL\n\t* GROUP BY clause: 2\n\t* ORDER BY clause: 1 desc\n2. Breaking down the query into more detailed parts:\n\t* COUNT (CASE_ID) - This part of the query retrieves the count of distinct CASE_IDs from the table.\n\t* \"Division\" - This part of the query retrieves the values in the \"Division\" column from the table.\n\t* \"defaultview-183\" - This is the name of the table from which the data is being retrieved.\n\t* \"Actual Finish Date\" = \"Scheduled Finish Date\" - This part of the query filters the data to only include rows where the \"Actual Finish Date\" column matches the \"Scheduled Finish Date\" column.\n\t* \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL - This part of the query filters the data to only include rows where the \"Planned Order Number\" column is null.\n\t* GROUP BY 2 - This part of the query groups the data by the values in the \"Division\" column.\n\t* ORDER BY 1 desc - This part of the query orders the results in descending order by the count of CASE_IDs.\n3. Constructing the signal_description by combining the parts:\n\t* Start with a brief summary of the query's purpose: \"Retrieve the count of distinct CASE_IDs from the 'defaultview-183' table where the 'Actual Finish Date' matches the 'Scheduled Finish Date' and 'Planned Order Number' is null.\"\n\t* Add details about the columns used in the query: \"Group the results by the 'Division' column and order them in descending order by the count of CASE_IDs.\"\n\t* Use proper grammar and punctuation to create a human-readable description.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and scope of the query without having to read the entire query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID), \"Division\"\nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Actual Finish Date\" = \"Scheduled Finish Date\" AND \"Planned Order Number\" IS NULL\nGROUP BY 2\nORDER BY 1 desc \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
