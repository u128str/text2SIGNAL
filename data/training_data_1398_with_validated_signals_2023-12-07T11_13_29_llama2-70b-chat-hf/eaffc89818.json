{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time in the 'defaultview-529' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the last and first end time in the 'defaultview-529' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\nThe SIGNAL query selects the average of the difference between the last and first end time in the \"defaultview-529\" table. The query uses the LAST and FIRST functions to retrieve the last and first end time values from the table, respectively. The difference between these two values is calculated using the minus (-) operator. The AVG function is then used to calculate the average of this difference.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the last end time from the \"defaultview-529\" table using the LAST function.\n2. Retrieve the first end time from the \"defaultview-529\" table using the FIRST function.\n3. Calculate the difference between the last and first end times using the minus (-) operator.\n4. Calculate the average of the difference using the AVG function.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should mention the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query, which are:\n\n* Table name: \"defaultview-529\"\n* Column names: end_time\n* Respective values: LAST(end_time) and FIRST(end_time)\n\nThe signal_description should also convey the meaning of the query, which is to calculate the average time difference between the last and first end times in the \"defaultview-529\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG((SELECT LAST(end_time)) - (SELECT FIRST(end_time)))\nFROM \"defaultview-529\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
