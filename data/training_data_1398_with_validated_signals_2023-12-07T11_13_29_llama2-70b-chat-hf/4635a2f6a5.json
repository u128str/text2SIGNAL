Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The SELECT clause: extracts the average cycle time for creating a PO and releasing it.\n\t* The FROM clause: specifies the table to use for the calculation (\"defaultview-124\").\n\t* The WHERE clause: filters the events to only those where the difference between the last and first event times for 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' events is greater than 3 days.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller parts:\n\t* The first part calculates the average cycle time for creating a PO:\n\t\t+ SELECT LAST(END_TIME) - FIRST(END_TIME)\n\t\t+ WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create PO Item'\n\t* The second part calculates the average cycle time for releasing a PO:\n\t\t+ SELECT LAST(END_TIME) - FIRST(END_TIME)\n\t\t+ WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO'\n\t* The third part calculates the difference between the two averages:\n\t\t+ SUBTRACTS the average cycle time for creating a PO from the average cycle time for releasing a PO\n\t* The fourth part multiplies the difference by 100:\n\t\t+ MULTIPLIES the difference by 100\n3. Creating a human-readable description that references the table name, column names, and respective values:\n\t* The description starts by stating the purpose of the calculation: \"Calculate the average cycle time for creating a purchase order (PO) and releasing it.\"\n\t* It then explains how the calculation is performed: \"The calculation is based on the difference between the last and first event times for 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' events, respectively, in the 'defaultview-124' table.\"\n\t* It highlights the filtering condition: \"The events must occur at least 3 days apart.\"\n\t* Finally, it mentions the multiplication by 100: \"And then multiply it by 100.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and logic behind the calculation.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n(\"Avg.
