{"signal_description": "Calculate the average time difference between the 'Released' and 'Create Process Order' events in the 'defaultview-183' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Calculate the average time difference between the 'Released' and 'Create Process Order' events in the 'defaultview-183' table.\"\n}\n\nThe signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n1. The first part of the query is SELECT AVG(..), which indicates that the query is calculating an average value.\n2. The next part is (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Released')), which selects the first end_time value where the event_name is 'Released'. This part is extracting the start time of the 'Released' event.\n3. The minus sign (-) indicates that the query is subtracting the start time of the 'Create Process Order' event from the start time of the 'Released' event.\n4. The last part is (SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Create Process Order')), which selects the last end_time value where the event_name is 'Create Process Order'. This part is extracting the end time of the 'Create Process Order' event.\n5. Finally, the query is selecting the average of the time difference between the 'Released' and 'Create Process Order' events from the \"defaultview-183\" table.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description summarizes the query as \"Calculate the average time difference between the 'Released' and 'Create Process Order' events in the 'defaultview-183' table.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nAVG(\n(SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Released'))\n-\n(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER(WHERE event_name = 'Create Process Order'))\n)\nFROM \"defaultview-183\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
