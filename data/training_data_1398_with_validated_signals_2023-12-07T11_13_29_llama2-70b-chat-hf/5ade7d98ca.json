In this case, we are selecting two columns: COUNT(CASE_ID) and DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()).\n* The second part of the query is a FILTER clause, which filters the data to only include rows that match certain conditions. In this case, we are filtering for rows where the \"Inventory Target\" column is greater than 0, the \"Stock on Hand\" column is greater than the \"Inventory Target\" column, and the month of the current date matches the \"MONTH\" column.\n* The third part of the query is another FILTER clause, which filters the data to only include rows that match the condition of the current date being in the same month as the \"MONTH\" column.\n* The fourth part of the query is a mathematical expression, which calculates the percentage of cases where the inventory target was exceeded by dividing the count of cases where the inventory target was exceeded by the total count of cases for the month, and then multiplying by 100.\n\nPutting it all together, we get the signal_description: \"For the current month, calculate the percentage of cases where the inventory target was exceeded, by dividing the count of cases where the inventory target was exceeded by the total count of cases for the month, and then multiplying by 100.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"Inventory Target\" > 0 \n\tAND \"Stock on Hand\" > \"Inventory Target\"\t\n\tAND DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n)\n/\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) FILTER(\n\tWHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()) = \"MONTH\"\n) * 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
