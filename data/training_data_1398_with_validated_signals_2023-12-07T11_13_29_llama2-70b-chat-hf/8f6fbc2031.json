In this case, we want to include the COUNT of the case_id column.\n* Next, we have the FILTER clause, which specifies the conditions under which the COUNT should be performed. In this case, we want to only count the case_ids where the event_name is 'Delete PO Item'.\n* We use the SELECT FIRST function to get the first event_name for each case_id, and then check if it is not null. If it is null, then we don't want to count that case_id.\n* Finally, we divide the count by the total number of case_ids and multiply by 100 to get a percentage.\n\nThe table name \"defaultview-57\" is specified in the FROM clause, and the column names used in the query are case_id, event_name, and FIRST(event_name).
