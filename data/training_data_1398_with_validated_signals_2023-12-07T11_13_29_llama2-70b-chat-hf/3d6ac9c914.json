{"signal_description": "This Signal query extracts various metrics related to invoice payment and processing from the 'defaultview-529' table. It filters the data to only include invoices where the last item due date is before the last item clearing date. The metrics include:\n\n* Company Code Name\n* Number of invoices paid late\n* Invoice amount in $ paid late\n* RCA Posted as Overdue\n* RCA Short Payment Terms\n* RCA High Rework Rate\n* RCA Dunning Block Release\n* RCA Low Automation of Invoice Postings\n* RCA Credit Memo Documents after Invoice Creation\n* RCA Manual Changes\n\nThe query uses a combination of SUM, COUNT, and FILTER functions to calculate these metrics. The FILTER functions are used to filter the data based on specific conditions, such as payment due dates and clearing dates. The query also uses a subquery to calculate the duration between the last item due date and the last item clearing date. The results are then ordered by the company code name, number of invoices paid late, and invoice amount in $ paid late.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"This Signal query extracts various metrics related to invoice payment and processing from the 'defaultview-529' table.
