Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-124\"\n2. Understanding the query structure:\n\t* The query selects the average of a difference between two values.\n\t* The difference is calculated by subtracting the first end_time of an event with the name 'Create Goods Receipt' from the last end_time of an event with the name 'Create FI Invoice'.\n\t* The events are filtered based on their names and the table name is specified as \"defaultview-124\".\n3. Breaking down the query into its components:\n\t* The first component is the subquery that selects the last end_time of an event with the name 'Create FI Invoice'.\n\t* The second component is the subquery that selects the first end_time of an event with the name 'Create Goods Receipt'.\n\t* The third component is the calculation that subtracts the second component from the first component.\n4. Creating a human-readable description:\n\t* The description starts with the phrase \"Calculate the average time difference between...\"\n\t* The description then specifies the two events being compared, \"the last 'Create FI Invoice' event\" and \"the first 'Create Goods Receipt' event\".\n\t* The description then specifies the table name, \"for each process instance in the 'defaultview-124' table.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it will be executed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create FI Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE event_name IN ('Create Goods Receipt'))\n   )\n)\n\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
