The FILTER clause is used to filter the rows based on the value of the \"event_name\" column, which should be 'Create Billing Document'.\n\nTo construct the signal_description, we first identify the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\n* The table name: \"defaultview-222\"\n* The column names: \"BillingDocument\", \"event_name\"\n* The filter condition: \"event_name = 'Create Billing Document'\"\n\nWe then construct the signal_description by combining these components into a human-readable instruction. The format of the instruction is:\n\n\"Count the number of unique [column name] rows in the [table name] table, where the [column name] column has the value [value].\"\n\nIn this case, the signal_description is:\n\n\"Count the number of unique 'BillingDocument' rows in the 'defaultview-222' table, where the 'event_name' column has the value 'Create Billing Document'.\"\n\nThis description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and scope of the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"BillingDocument\") FILTER (\n\tWHERE event_name ='Create Billing Document')\n\nFROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-222\") \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
