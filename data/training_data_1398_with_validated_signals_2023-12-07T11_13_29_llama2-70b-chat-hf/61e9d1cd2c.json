Next, we identified the column names and their respective values used in the query:\n\t* \"case_id\"\n\t* \"END_TIME\"\n\t* \"Release PO\"\n3. We then analyzed the query's WHERE clause, which contains a subquery that calculates the time difference between the current date (NOW()) and the last release PO end time.\n4. We also identified the duration values '25DAYS' and '45DAYS', which are used to filter the results.\n5. Finally, we constructed the signal_description by combining the information gathered in steps 1-4, using a human-readable format that includes the table name, column names, and respective values.\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and the data it retrieves.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(NOW() - (SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Release PO')) - DURATION '25DAYS' > DURATION '45DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
