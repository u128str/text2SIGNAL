Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Using the information gathered in steps 1-3, a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query was constructed. The description includes the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query, as well as a brief explanation of the logic behind the query.\n\nThe resulting signal_description is a concise summary of the SIGNAL query that can be easily understood by a user who is familiar with the table schema and column names.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID) AS \"No. of Cases\"\nFROM \"defaultview-124\"\nWHERE\n(SELECT LAST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Clear Invoice') - (SELECT FIRST(END_TIME) WHERE EVENT_NAME = 'Create FI Invoice') > DURATION '9DAYS' \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
