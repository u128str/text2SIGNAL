Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: Retrieves specific columns from the table.\n\t* FROM clause: Specifies the table to query.\n\t* WHERE clause: Filters the results based on a condition.\n\t* ORDER BY clause: Sorts the results in a specific order.\n\t* LIMIT clause: Limits the number of rows returned.\n2. Breaking down each component into its constituent parts:\n\t* SELECT clause:\n\t\t+ \"SUM (\\\"PO Item Total Amount\\\") AS \\\"Total PO Amount\\\"\": Calculates the sum of the \"PO Item Total Amount\" column and assigns it to a new column called \"Total PO Amount\".\n\t\t+ \", \\\"PO Item Supplier ID\\\" AS \\\"Vendor Name\\\"\": Selects the \"PO Item Supplier ID\" column and assigns it to a new column called \"Vendor Name\".\n\t* FROM clause:\n\t\t+ \"\\\"defaultview-431\\\"\": Specifies the table to query, which is named \"defaultview-431\".\n\t* WHERE clause:\n\t\t+ \"\\\"PO Item Supplier ID\\\" IS NOT NULL\": Filters out any PO items with a null supplier ID.\n\t* ORDER BY clause:\n\t\t+ \"1 DESC\": Sorts the results in descending order based on the first column (in this case, the \"Total PO Amount\" column).\n\t* LIMIT clause:\n\t\t+ \"LIMIT 10\": Limits the number of rows returned to 10.\n3. Constructing the signal_description by combining the parts:\n\t* Starting with the table name and columns schema: \"Retrieve the top 10 PO items with the highest total amount, along with their supplier name, from the 'defaultview-431' table.\"\n\t* Adding the filter condition: \"The query filters out any PO items with a null supplier ID.\"\n\t* Adding the sorting and limiting conditions: \"The results are sorted in descending order by the total amount and limited to 10 rows.\"\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise explanation of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand the query's purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nSUM (\"PO Item Total Amount\") AS \"Total PO Amount\", \n\"PO Item Supplier ID\" AS \"Vendor Name\"\nFROM \"defaultview-431\"\nWHERE \"PO Item Supplier ID\" IS NOT NULL\nORDER BY 1 DESC\nLIMIT 10 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
