In this case, we want to include a single column that contains the percentage of goods receipts that were not reversed.\n* Next, we have the COUNT(case_id) function, which counts the number of case IDs that match a certain condition. In this case, we want to count the number of case IDs where the event name matches 'Create Goods Receipt'. We use the FILTER clause to specify this condition.\n* Then, we have the - operator, which subtracts the number of case IDs where the event name matches 'Reverse Goods Receipt' from the total number of case IDs where the event name matches 'Create Goods Receipt'.\n* After that, we have the / operator, which divides the result of the subtraction by the total number of case IDs where the event name matches 'Create Goods Receipt'.\n* Finally, we have the * 100 operator, which multiplies the result of the division by 100 to express the result as a percentage.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a signal_description that explains the calculation performed by the SIGNAL query in a human-readable way.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT (COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create Goods Receipt'))\n\t)\n\t-\n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (event_name MATCHES('Reverse Goods Receipt'))\n\t))\n\t/\n\tCOUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n\tWHERE (event_name MATCHES('Create Goods Receipt'))\n\t)\n\t* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-57\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
