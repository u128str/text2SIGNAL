The first column is a CASE expression that evaluates different conditions based on the values of two columns: \"Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period\" and \"Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD\". The second column is a simple COUNT of the number of case IDs.\n* The CASE expression is broken down into several WHEN clauses that check different conditions. Each WHEN clause has a specific action that returns a string value based on the condition. The ELSE clause returns the string 'ok'.\n* The query also includes a FROM clause that specifies the table to use for the query, which is named \"defaultview-225\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a concise summary of what the SIGNAL query does, highlighting the main elements of the query, such as the table name, column names, and the conditions evaluated in the CASE expression.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCASE \n\tWHEN \"Last Inv.
