SELECT: The query starts by selecting a column from the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n2. COUNT(case_id): The selected column is counted, and the result is assigned to a variable.\n3. FILTER(WHERE): The COUNT result is then filtered based on a condition. The condition is that the number of distinct event_names for each case_id must be equal to the total number of event_names.\n4. COUNT(DISTINCT event_name): The number of distinct event_names for each case_id is counted and compared to the total number of event_names.\n5. / COUNT(case_id): The filtered COUNT result is divided by the total count of case_ids.\n6. *100: The result is then multiplied by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n\nThe signal_description explains each step of the query in a way that is easy to understand, making it helpful for users who may not be familiar with the SIGNAL language or the schema of the \"defaultview-545\" table.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nCOUNT(case_id) FILTER(\n\tWHERE (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT event_name)) = (SELECT COUNT(event_name))\n\t)\n/ COUNT(case_id)\n*100\n\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
