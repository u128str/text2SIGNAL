SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") and COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (WHERE (\"EventCreatedByUserType\" IS NOT NULL)).\n2. FILTER clause:\nThe first filter is applied to the COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") column, which filters the results to only include rows where the EventCreatedByUserType is either 'System' or 'Service'.\n3. MATCHES clause:\nThe second filter is applied to the created_auto column, which filters the results to only include rows where the created_auto value matches the value in the EventCreatedByUserType column.\n4. Calculation:\nThe query performs a calculation on the filtered counts, dividing the first count by the second count and multiplying the result by 100.\n5. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the flattened table 'defaultview-383'.\n6. WHERE clause:\nThe query filters the results to only include rows where the event_name contains 'Sales' and ChangeType is 'Update'.\n\nBy combining these components, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      BEHAVIOR (\n        \"EventCreatedByUserType\" IN ('System', 'Service')\n        AND (\n          event_name LIKE '%Sales%'\n          AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n        )\n      ) AS created_auto MATCHES (created_auto)\n  ) / COUNT(DISTINCT \"UniqueEventId\") FILTER (\n          WHERE\n(\"EventCreatedByUserType\" IS NOT NULL)\n        )\n    * 100\nFROM\n  FLATTEN(\"defaultview-383\")\nWHERE\n  (\n    event_name LIKE '%Sales%'\n    AND ChangeType = 'Update'\n  ) \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
