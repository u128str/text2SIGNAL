{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' values from the 'defaultview-225' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is quite straightforward. It selects the count of distinct values in the column named \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\" from a table named \"defaultview-225\".\n\nTo create the human-readable description, we can start by mentioning the table name, which is \"defaultview-225\". Then, we can specify the column name, which is \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\", and mention that we want to retrieve the count of distinct values in this column. Finally, we can wrap the description in curly braces to conform to the expected JSON format.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. Start with the table name: \"defaultview-225\"\n2. Mention the column name: \"Inv. Accounting Document Number\"\n3. Specify the operation: \"count of distinct\"\n4. Wrap the description in curly braces to conform to JSON format: { ... }\n\nThe resulting signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query does without having to read the actual SQL code.", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
