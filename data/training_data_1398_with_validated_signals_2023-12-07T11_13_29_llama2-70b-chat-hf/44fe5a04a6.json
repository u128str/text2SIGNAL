In this case, we have one column, AVG, and one table, \"defaultview-225\".\n* Next, we have the WHERE clause, which filters the rows to be processed based on two conditions. The first condition is that the 'Last Payment Clearing Date' column must not be null, and the second condition is that the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' column must be greater than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' column.\n* Then, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table to be processed. In this case, it is \"defaultview-225\".\n* After that, we have the SELECT clause, which specifies the columns to be returned. In this case, we have one column, AVG.\n* Finally, we have the mathematical expression, which calculates the average of the differences between the last end time of events named 'Clear Invoice' and the first end time of events named 'Post Invoice'.\n\nThe signal_description is constructed by combining these parts into a single sentence, using natural language to describe the table and column names and their respective values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) \n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Post Invoice'))) \n        \nFROM \"defaultview-225\" \nWHERE 'Last Payment Clearing Date' IS NOT NULL\n    AND (\"Last Inv.
