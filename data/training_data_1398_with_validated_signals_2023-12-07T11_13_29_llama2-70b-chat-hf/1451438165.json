{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of case_id from the 'defaultview-183' table where the 'Planned Order Number' column is null.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of case_id from the 'defaultview-183' table where the 'Planned Order Number' column is null.\"\n}\n\nThis signal_description was constructed by analyzing the SIGNAL query and breaking it down into its component parts.\n\n* The first part of the query is \"SELECT count(case_id)\". This tells us that the query is selecting a count of a specific column, in this case, \"case_id\".\n* The next part of the query is \"FROM 'defaultview-183'\". This tells us that the query is operating on a specific table, named \"defaultview-183\".\n* The final part of the query is \"WHERE 'Planned Order Number' is null\". This tells us that the query is filtering the results to only include rows where the \"Planned Order Number\" column is null.\n\nPutting all of this information together, we can construct a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query, which is: \"Retrieve the count of case_id from the 'defaultview-183' table where the 'Planned Order Number' column is null.\"", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(case_id) \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\nWHERE \"Planned Order Number\" is null \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
