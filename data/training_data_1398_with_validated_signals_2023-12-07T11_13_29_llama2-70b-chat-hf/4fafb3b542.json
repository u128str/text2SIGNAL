{"signal_description": "Retrieve the count of distinct event names from the 'defaultview-9' table.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of distinct event names from the 'defaultview-9' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query `SELECT count(DISTINCT event_name) FROM \"defaultview-9\"` can be broken down into several parts:\n\n1. `SELECT`: This is the selection clause, which specifies the columns to be retrieved. In this case, we are interested in the count of distinct event names.\n2. `count(DISTINCT event_name)`: This is the aggregation clause, which performs the count operation on the `event_name` column. The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only unique values are counted.\n3. `FROM \"defaultview-9\"`: This is the table clause, which specifies the table from which the data should be retrieved. In this case, the table name is `\"defaultview-9\"`.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should highlight these key aspects of the query:\n\n* Retrieve the count of distinct event names\n* From the 'defaultview-9' table\n\nThis description provides a concise summary of the query, making it easier for users to understand the purpose and scope of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT count(DISTINCT event_name) FROM \"defaultview-9\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
