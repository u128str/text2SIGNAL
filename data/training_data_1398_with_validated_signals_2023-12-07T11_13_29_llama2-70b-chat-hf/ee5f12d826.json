{"signal_description": "LLM Parser Error", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of 'case_id' where the 'Current Status category' is 'Done' from the 'defaultview-370' table.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is a SQL-like query that is used to retrieve data from a table. In this case, the table name is \"defaultview-370\". The query uses the \"count\" function to retrieve the count of a specific column, which is denoted by the alias \"case_id\". The query also uses the \"FILTER\" clause to filter the results based on a condition, which is that the value of the column \"Current Status category\" must be 'Done'.\n\nTo summarize this query, we can break it down into several parts:\n\n1. The first part is \"SELECT count(\\\"case_id\\\")\", which retrieves the count of the \"case_id\" column.\n2. The second part is \"FILTER ( WHERE \\\"Current Status category\\\" == 'Done')\", which filters the results to only include rows where the value of the \"Current Status category\" column is 'Done'.\n3. The final part is \"FROM \\\"defaultview-370\\\"\", which specifies the table name from which the data should be retrieved.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description should accurately reflect the parts of the query and provide a clear instruction for a human reader to understand what the query is doing. The expected output result in JSON format is:\n{\n\"signal_description\": \"Retrieve the count of 'case_id' where the 'Current Status category' is 'Done' from the 'defaultview-370' table.\"\n}\n\nThis summary provides a concise and clear instruction that a human reader can understand, and it accurately reflects the parts of the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": "Failed to parse Signal2Text from completion.
