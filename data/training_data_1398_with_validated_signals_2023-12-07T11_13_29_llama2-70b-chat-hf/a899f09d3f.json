Identifying the table name: \"defaultview-545\"\n2. Understanding the query's syntax:\n\t* SELECT AVG(expression) FROM table_name\n\t* Expression is a subtraction of two subqueries\n\t* First subquery: SELECT LAST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Pay Invoice')\n\t* Second subquery: SELECT FIRST(end_time) WHERE event_name IN ('Receive Invoice', 'Reconcile Invoice')\n3. Breaking down the subqueries:\n\t* First subquery:\n\t\t+ SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\t+ WHERE event_name IN ('Pay Invoice')\n\t\t+ This subquery returns the last 'end_time' value for events with 'Pay Invoice' name in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n\t* Second subquery:\n\t\t+ SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\t+ WHERE event_name IN ('Receive Invoice', 'Reconcile Invoice')\n\t\t+ This subquery returns the first 'end_time' value for events with 'Receive Invoice' or 'Reconcile Invoice' name in the \"defaultview-545\" table.\n4. Understanding the expression:\n\t* The expression is the subtraction of the first subquery's result from the second subquery's result.\n\t* It calculates the time difference between the last 'Pay Invoice' event and the first 'Receive Invoice' or 'Reconcile Invoice' event.\n5. Crafting the signal_description:\n\t* Using the information gathered, a human-readable description of the signal was constructed, including the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.\n\t* The description is written in a style that resembles a set of instructions, explaining what the signal does and how it was constructed.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \n\nSELECT\nAVG(\n\t(SELECT LAST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Pay Invoice'))\n\t-(SELECT FIRST(end_time)\n\t\tWHERE event_name IN ('Receive Invoice', 'Reconcile Invoice'))\n   )\nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\n                 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
