First, we have a SELECT clause that retrieves two columns: \"Invoice Clearing Date\" and \"Payment Rate\".\n2. The \"Invoice Clearing Date\" column is calculated using a subquery that retrieves the last END_TIME of the 'Clear Invoice' events. This is done using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates the date to the first day of the month.\n3. The \"Payment Rate\" column is calculated using a nested COUNT and FILTER clause. First, we filter the cases where the last invoice item due date is before the last clearing date. Then, we count the number of cases that pass this filter and divide it by the total number of cases with a non-null clearing date. Finally, we multiply the result by 100 to express it as a percentage.\n4. The query is filtered to only include events with the names 'Post Invoice' and 'Clear Invoice'.\n5. The results are sorted in ascending order by the \"Invoice Clearing Date\" column.\n6. Finally, missing values in the timeseries are filled in with a monthly granularity using the FILL function.\n\nThe signal_description provides a step-by-step explanation of how the query works, making it easier for users to understand the logic behind the SIGNAL query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tDATE_TRUNC('MONTH', (SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Clear Invoice')))) AS \"Invoice Clearing Date\",\n        \n    COUNT(case_id) FILTER (\n    WHERE\n      (\n        \"Last Inv.
