Cycle time\".\n* The next part is \"PO Item Material Group Text\", which tells us that we are selecting a specific column from the table, specifically the \"PO Item Material Group Text\" column.\n* The FROM clause tells us that we are selecting data from the \"defaultview-124\" table.\n* The ORDER BY clause tells us that we are sorting the results by the \"No. of Cases\" column in descending order (1 DESC).\n* The LIMIT 50 clause tells us that we are limiting the number of rows returned in the result set to 50.\n\nTherefore, the signal_description provides a concise summary of the SIGNAL query, describing the table and columns used, the calculations performed, and the sorting and limiting of the result set.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \nCOUNT (\"case_id\") AS \"No. of Cases\", \nAVG ((SELECT LAST (\"end_time\") - FIRST (\"end_time\"))) AS \"Avg.
