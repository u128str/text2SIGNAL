{"signal_description": "Count of distinct Product IDs where Recommended Safety Stock is 0, filtered by months within the last 320 days from the current month.", "llm_output": " {\n\"signal_description\": \"Count of distinct Product IDs where Recommended Safety Stock is 0, filtered by months within the last 320 days from the current month.\"\n}\n\nExplanation:\n\nThe SIGNAL query is constructed using the SELECT statement, with two filters applied using the FILTER clause. The first filter is based on the SUM of the \"Recommended Safety Stock\" column being equal to 0, and the second filter is based on the \"MONTH\" column being greater than or equal to the current month and less than 320 days from the current month. The query then calculates the count of distinct \"Product ID\" values that meet these filters, and finally multiplies the result by 100.\n\nTo summarize the query, we can break it down into the following steps:\n\n1. Filter the data to only include rows where the SUM of \"Recommended Safety Stock\" is 0.\n2. Filter the data to only include rows where the \"MONTH\" column is within the last 320 days from the current month.\n3. Calculate the count of distinct \"Product ID\" values that meet the above filters.\n4. Multiply the count by 100.\n\nThe resulting summary describes the count of distinct Product IDs that meet the specified filters, which can be useful for analyzing product sales or inventory data.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER(\n\tWHERE (\n\t\tSELECT SUM(\"Recommended Safety Stock\") = 0\n\t)\n\tAND \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n)\n/\nCOUNT(DISTINCT \"Product ID\") FILTER(\n\tWHERE \"MONTH\" >= (DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW()))\n\tAND (\"MONTH\" - DATE_TRUNC('month', NOW())) < DURATION '320days'\n)\n* 100\nFROM \"defaultview-404\" \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
