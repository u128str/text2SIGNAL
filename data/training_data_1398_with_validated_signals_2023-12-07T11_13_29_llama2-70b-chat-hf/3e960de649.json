SELECT clause:\nThe query selects two columns: \"Invoice Post Date\" and \"Average cycle time\".\n2. DATE_TRUNC function:\nThe first column, \"Invoice Post Date\", is created using the DATE_TRUNC function, which truncates a date to a specified interval (in this case, 'month'). The date used for truncation is the FIRST end time of an invoice posting event.\n3. FIRST and LAST functions:\nThe second column, \"Average cycle time\", is calculated using the FIRST and LAST functions. The FIRST function returns the first end time of an invoice posting event, and the LAST function returns the last end time of an invoice clearing event. The difference between these two times is calculated and divided by the number of days in the month.\n4. FILTER clause:\nThe events used for calculation are selected using the FILTER clause, which filters the events based on the event name. Only events with names matching the pattern \"Post Invoice\" or \"Clear Invoice\" are selected.\n5. FROM clause:\nThe query is applied to the \"defaultview-225\" table.\n6. WHERE clause:\nThe events are filtered based on the event name, and only events with names matching the pattern \"Post Invoice\" or \"Clear Invoice\" are selected.\n7. ORDER BY clause:\nThe results are ordered by the invoice posting date in ascending order, with null values filled in at the beginning of each month.\n\nBy combining these parts, we get a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that explains its purpose and how it works.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n  DATE_TRUNC(\n    'month',\n    (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Invoice Post Date\",\n  AVG(\n    (\n      SELECT\n        LAST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Post Invoice')\n        )\n    ) - (\n      SELECT\n        FIRST(end_time) FILTER (\n          WHERE\n            event_name IN ('Clear Invoice')\n        )\n    )\n  ) AS \"Average cycle time\"\nFROM\n  \"defaultview-225\"\nWHERE\n  event_name MATCHES ('Post Invoice' ~> 'Clear Invoice')\nORDER BY\n  1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'),\n  NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
