In this case, we are selecting the average of a difference between two values.\n* Next, we have the FROM clause, which specifies the table from which we want to retrieve data. In this case, we are using the \"defaultview-431\" table.\n* Then, we have the WHERE clause, which specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the output. In this case, we are filtering for rows where the event name matches a certain pattern and two specific dates are in a certain relationship.\n* Finally, we have the FILTER clauses, which allow us to apply additional filters to the data. In this case, we are using two FILTER clauses to select the last end time for events named 'Pay Invoice' and the first end time for events named 'Receive Invoice'.\n\nBy combining these parts, we can create a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that is easy to understand and reference the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT \n\tAVG ((SELECT LAST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Pay Invoice'))) \n\t- (SELECT FIRST (END_TIME) FILTER (\n    \tWHERE EVENT_NAME IN ('Receive Invoice')))) \n\nFROM \"defaultview-431\" \nWHERE event_name Matches ('Receive Invoice' ~> 'Pay Invoice')\n    AND (\"Last Invoice Due Date\" > \"Last Invoice Payment Date\")  \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
