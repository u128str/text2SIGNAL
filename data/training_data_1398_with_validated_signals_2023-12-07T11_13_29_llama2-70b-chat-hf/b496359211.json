Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* The query is selecting a count of CASE_IDs.\n\t* The query is filtering the results to only include rows where the EVENT_NAME is 'Update PO Item Quantity'.\n\t* The query is grouping the results by CASE_ID.\n\t* The query is selecting only the rows where the count of CASE_IDs is greater than 1.\n2. Breaking down the query into smaller, more manageable parts:\n\t* The first part of the query is selecting the count of CASE_IDs and assigning it to a column called \"CASE_COUNT\".\n\t* The second part of the query is filtering the results to only include rows where the EVENT_NAME is 'Update PO Item Quantity'.\n\t* The third part of the query is grouping the results by CASE_ID.\n\t* The fourth part of the query is selecting only the rows where the count of CASE_IDs is greater than 1.\n3. Constructing the signal_description by describing each part of the query in a human-readable format:\n\t* \"Retrieve the count of distinct CASE_IDs from the 'defaultview-124' table\"\n\t* \"where the EVENT_NAME is 'Update PO Item Quantity'\"\n\t* \"and the count of CASE_IDs is greater than 1.\"\n\nThe signal_description is a human-readable description of the SIGNAL query that explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values used in the query.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\nCOUNT(CASE_ID)\nFROM\n(\n SELECT\n  COUNT(CASE_ID) AS \"CASE_COUNT\", CASE_ID, EVENT_NAME\n FROM FLATTEN(\"defaultview-124\")\n WHERE\n  EVENT_NAME IN ('Update PO Item Quantity') \n GROUP BY 2,3\n) AS SUB1\nWHERE \"CASE_COUNT\" > 1 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
