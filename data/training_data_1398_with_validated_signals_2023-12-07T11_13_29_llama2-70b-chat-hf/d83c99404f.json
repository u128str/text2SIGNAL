This is described as \"filter the rows where the actual delivery date is after the scheduled finish date by more than 0 seconds\".\n* Then, we have a calculation clause that calculates the late delivery rate by dividing the count of filtered rows by the total count of rows and multiplying by 100. This is described as \"calculate the late delivery rate by dividing the count of filtered rows by the total count of rows and multiplying by 100\".\n* After that, we have another calculation clause that calculates the average delay by taking the average of the differences between the actual delivery date and scheduled finish date for the filtered rows. This is described as \"calculate the average delay by taking the average of the differences between the actual delivery date and scheduled finish date for the filtered rows\".\n* Finally, we have an order clause that orders the results by the late delivery rate in descending order and a limit clause that limits the results to the top 10 rows. This is described as \"order the results by the late delivery rate in descending order and limit the results to the top 10 rows\".\n\nOverall, the signal_description provides a clear and concise summary of the SIGNAL query, making it easier for users to understand what the query is doing without having to read the actual query code.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (\nWHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds') \n/ COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 as \"Late delivery rate\",\navg(\"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\") \nFilter(WHERE \"Actual Delivery Date\" - \"Scheduled Finish Date\" > DURATION '0seconds') \nas \"Avg delay\",\n\"Plant\" \nFROM \"defaultview-183\"\norder by 1 desc\nLIMIT 10 \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
