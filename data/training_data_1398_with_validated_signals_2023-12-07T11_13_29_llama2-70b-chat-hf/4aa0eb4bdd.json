Identifying the main components of the SIGNAL query:\n\t* SELECT clause: DATE_TRUNC('day', end_time) AS \"Day\", COUNT (EVENT_NAME) as \"Partial Confirmations\"\n\t* FROM clause: FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\")\n\t* WHERE clause: EVENT_NAME = 'Partially confirmed'\n\t* ORDER BY clause: ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\n2. Breaking down the SELECT clause into its components:\n\t* DATE_TRUNC('day', end_time) AS \"Day\" - extracts the day of the end time and formats it as a date truncated to the day level\n\t* COUNT (EVENT_NAME) as \"Partial Confirmations\" - counts the number of events with the name 'Partially confirmed'\n3. Identifying the table name and column names used in the query:\n\t* FLATTEN(\"defaultview-183\") - the table name is \"defaultview-183\"\n\t* EVENT_NAME - the column name is \"EVENT_NAME\"\n\t* end_time - the column name is \"end_time\"\n4.
