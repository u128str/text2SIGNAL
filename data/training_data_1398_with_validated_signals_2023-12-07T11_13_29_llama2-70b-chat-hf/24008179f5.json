The table name, column names, and respective values are explicitly referenced in the description.\n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown of how the signal_description was constructed:\n\n1. The first part of the query is \"SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time))) as Month,\" which retrieves the first day of each month from the end time column. This is described as \"Retrieve the number of cases where the event name is like '%Update%' or '%Change%' and calculate the change rate for each month.\"\n2. The second part of the query is \"COUNT (CASE_ID) FILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Update%' OR EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Change%')))\", which counts the number of cases where the event name is like '%Update%' or '%Change%'. This is described as \"The data is filtered using the BOOL_OR function and the result is calculated using the COUNT function.\"\n3. The third part of the query is \"/ COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS \"Change Rate\"\", which calculates the change rate by dividing the count of cases by the total number of cases and multiplying by 100. This is described as \"The data is then ordered by the month column in ascending order, with null values placed first.\"\n4. The final part of the query is \"FROM \"defaultview-545\" ORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST FILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL\", which specifies the table to query, sorts the data by the month column in ascending order with null values placed first, and fills in missing values in the time series using the DATE_TRUNC function. This is described as \"The query uses the DATE_TRUNC function to truncate the end time to the first day of the month.\"\n\nBy combining these parts, the signal_description provides a human-readable summary of the SIGNAL query that explicitly references the table name, column names, and respective values.", "error_message": null, "llm_input": "[INST]\nYou are SIGNAL assistant, a part of SAP Signavio's Process Intelligence Suite. \nSIGNAL stands for Signavio Analytics Language. \nSIGNAL is a dialect of SQL.\nYour goal is to help users craft SIGNAL \nqueries and understand the SIGNAL language better. \n\nTask to solve:\n\nSummarize the given SIGNAL query as a human-readable description with explicit reference to the table name,\nthe column names and respective values if they are used in the Signal query.\nSummarization style should look like a set of the instructions written by human who knows the table name, columns schema and respective values. \nExplain how this signal_description was constructed.\n\nSIGNAL query: \nSELECT\n    DATE_TRUNC('month', (SELECT FIRST(end_time))) as Month,\n    \n    COUNT (CASE_ID) \n\tFILTER (WHERE (SELECT BOOL_OR (EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Update%' \n\t\tOR EVENT_NAME ILIKE '%Change%'))) \n/ COUNT (CASE_ID) * 100 AS \"Change Rate\"\n    \nFROM \"defaultview-545\"\nORDER BY 1 ASC NULLS FIRST\nFILL TIMESERIES('MONTH'), NULL \n \nExpected output result is in JSON format:\n{\n\"signal_description\": text of the Signal summary should be here\n}\nDo not output any other text, apart from the above JSON.\n[/INST]\n"}
