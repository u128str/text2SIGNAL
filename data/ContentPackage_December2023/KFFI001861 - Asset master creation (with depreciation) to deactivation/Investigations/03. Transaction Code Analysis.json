That is why it is necessary to manage the asset as a separate asset master record (asset under construction) during the construction phase. As soon as the transition between the two stages starts, the asset under construction is capitalized and the asset under construction is settled to a final asset. There are different methods of settling an asset under construction - this can either be done using controlling settlement (transaction CJ88, KO88), or in asset accounting for settling independent assets under constructions (transaction AIBU).","type":"unstyled","key":"25kke","entityRanges":[]}]}},"filters":[],"children":[]},{"name":"Top 10 transaction codes used for asset retirement by company code","id":"top-10-transaction-codes-used-34","visualization":{"type":"BAR_CHART","orientation":"HORIZONTAL","grouping":"STACKED"},"dataSource":{"type":"SIGNAL","query":"SELECT \"# Cases\", \n\t\t\"Transaction code\", \n        \"Company code\"\nFROM (\n       SELECT \n         DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY \"Sum\" DESC) as \"DENSE_RANK\",\n         \"# Cases\", \n         \"Transaction code\", \n         \"Company code\",\n         \"Sum\"\n       FROM (\n       SELECT  COUNT(\"case_id\") AS \"# Cases\", \n         \"6 - Other - TCode (Ret.)
