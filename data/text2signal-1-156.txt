Query language of SAP Signavio Process Intelligence optimized for performing process mining tasks on large
amounts  of event data
SAP  Signavio Analytics Language, SIGNAL is a specialized query language for process analysis.
The language is based on SQL. Like SQL, you use queries to retrieve data and perform calculations on the data.
However, it is not possible to change or delete process data.
The difference to SQL is the data model. While you usually query data from multiple tables with SQL, SIGNAL
queries the data from only one table, which contains nested events. In addition, SIGNAL provides numerous
custom  functions to work more effectively with this data structure.
SIGNAL  is optimized for process mining, for example to determine conformance, cycle times, and rework, and
it supports exploration at scale by all kind of SAP Signavio Process Intelligence users.
With SIGNAL, you can only retrieve data from processes to which you have access.


Data   model

When  mining the data of a process, you retrieve the data of a single table. This table contains the case
attributes and their nested events and event attributes. The following table shows this nested structure.
 case_ID      Customer ID  Status       City         events
 1001         2001         delivered    Berlin

SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
SAP Signavio Analytics Language                                                             PUBLIC     3The columns  case_id,  event_name  and end_time   are always present. Case attributes like Customer ID,
Status,  and City have the same value throughout the case. Additional event attributes, in this example
Payment   method  and Cancellation    reason  can have different values for each event.
There are two ways to iterate over this data:
    per case
    Each case is treated as one row. The nested events and event attributes are represented as a nested table.
    per event
    Each event is treated as one row. The case ID and case attributes are repeated for each event.

Data   types
The data type of a column defines which value the column can hold. All data types can occur on case level as
well as on event level (nested).
SIGNAL  supports the following data types:
    Strings
    Numbers  stored as double precision floating point
    Timestamps  stored with millisecond precision, without time zone information.
    Durations stored with millisecond precision
    Booleans
All of these data types can appear in the source file and in the query result.
Both case and event attributes can be Null, indicating the absence of a value or an unknown value.

Process    mining
SIGNAL  queries are used in the widgets of an investigation.
When  configuring widgets, you have the following options:
    Create you own queries
    Use the default queries in the widgets and customize them if necessary
    Use the predefined queries from the metrics library and customize them if necessary
    Add your own queries to the metrics library for reuse
Read more  on the widgets in section Widgets.

SIGNAL follows a specific syntax that is described throughout this documentation using a special notation.
The syntax of SIGNAL is based on SQL but enhanced with functions to run in-depth process analysis queries.
All queries always follow this basic structure:
  SELECT expressions
 FROM  table/process
  WHERE conditions
  .& Example
  Example
         1  SELECT   count(case_id)
          2 FROM  THIS_PROCESS
         3  WHERE   "Customer    Type"   =  'Premium
         4  and    "Order   Status"    = 'Canceled'




     Premium      customers     with  canceled
      orders
     42



  This query counts the cases in the declared table for which the condition is true.

Syntax    Notation
The following notation is used to describe the syntax of SIGNAL. Note that this notation isn't part of the actual
query:
    Angle brackets indicate a required element. Don't include the angle brackets as part of a query.
SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
SAP Signavio Analytics Language                                                       PUBLIC   5
800    Example: ORDER   BY <expression>
    Square brackets indicate optional elements. Don't include the square brackets as part of a query.
    Example:[  WHERE   <condition>    ]
    The pipe symbol indicates a choice between two or more options. They're listed within square brackets
    (meaning  inclusion of a choice is optional) or curly brackets (meaning one of the options must be chosen).
    Don't include the pipe or brackets as part of a query.
    Example:  [ ASC  | DESC  ]
    Example: { AND   | OR  }
    An ellipsis indicates that the preceding element can be repeated an arbitrary number of times.
    Example:GROUP    BY columnIndex    [,  columnIndex    ...]



Keywords

SIGNAL  keywords  are case-insensitive, but are by convention written upper-case to distinguish them from
expressions. Read more on keywords in section SIGNAL keywords [page 136].



Attribute    Names

Attribute names are case-insensitive. In the following cases, the attribute name must be enclosed in double
quotes:
    The attribute shares the same name a reserved SIGNAL keyword.
    The attribute doesn't start with a letter or an underscore.
    The attribute name contains characters other than letters, numbers, or underscores.
    If the attribute name is enclosed in double quotes, the entire expression must be enclosed in double
    quotes.
    Example: "Premium  User" -> ""Premium User""
    If the attribute name contains one or more double quotes, these double quotes must be followed by a
    double quote.
    Example: Width in " (inches) -> "Width in "" (inches)"
    If the attribute name contains one or more single quotes, these single quotes must be followed by a double
    quote.
    Example: O'Reilly -> "O""Reilly"



Attribute    Values

Attribute values are, where applicable, case-sensitive. Attribute values of type String, Timestamp, and Duration
must always be enclosed in single quotes.

For SIGNAL, the following pre-defined semantic attributes are always present:
    case_id:  Unique identifier of the case
    event_name:   Event names of the case ordered by their time
    end_time:  End timestamps  of the events of a case
    start_time:   Start timestamps of the events of a case, can be null if not available in the source data
The syntax rules for semantic attributes are the same as for the other attributes.


1.2       SIGNAL        aliases
Learn about aliases in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process Intelligence.
Aliases are used to give the result set a temporary name to make the column headings in your result set
easier to read. It's common to alias a column when using an aggregate function in a query. Without an alias, a
name  will be generated based on the column and operations in the expression. Read more in section SIGNAL
functions [page 66].
An alias is only valid within the scope of the SIGNAL statement.
Syntax:
  expression   AS  alias_name
 Parameter                          Description                        Required
 expression                         The expression that you want to give a Required
                                    better name.
 alias_name                         The temporary name to assign.      Required
                                    Enclose the name in double quotes if it
                                    contains a character that isn't a letter
                                    or digit.
Example:
In this example, we have the following data in a table:
 case_id                            event_name                         end_time
 1001                               Receive customer order             2020-07-01T09:00:00
 1002                               Receive customer order             2020-07-04T13:00:00
 1003                               Receive customer order             2020-07-05T11:00:00
Enter the following SIGNAL statement:
  SELECT  COUNT(case_id)     AS  "No.  of  cases"

1.3       SIGNAL         SELECT        statement          and    clauses


Learn about the SELECT  statement and the available clauses in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of
SAP  Signavio Process Intelligence
In this section, it is explained how to use the SELECT statement and clauses in SIGNAL.



SELECT      statement


The SELECT   statement is used to select data from a process. It fetches data from columns and rows from the
table. The data returned is the result set.
Syntax:
  SELECT  expressions
 FROM   table
  [TABLESAMPLE]
  [WHERE]
  [GROUP  BY]
  [UNION  ALL]
  [ORDER  BY]
  [FILL]
  [LIMIT]
  [OFFSET]

 Parameter                                            Description
 expressions                                          The columns or calculations that you want to retrieve.
 table                                                The process table or view from which you want to retrieve
                                                      data. You can reference the process by using the explicit
                                                      Process ID which can be found on the API tab in the
                                                      process settings page. Alternatively you can use the alias
                                                      THIS_PROCESS  to refer to the default view.
 TABLESAMPLE                                          Specify the absolute or percentage table fraction to be con-
                                                      sidered for the query.
 WHERE  condition                                     The condition that must be met for the records to be se-

A subquery is a query that is nested inside a SELECT statement or inside another subquery. You can use a
subquery anywhere an expression is allowed to retrieve data on event-level.
Subqueries are allowed in the FROM clause as well as in the FLATTEN operator.
Syntax:
  SELECT  (
      SELECT  (event_name)
  )
 FROM  table

 Parameter                                         Description
 event name                                        The column or expression from which you want to retrieve
                                                   the first element.
 table                                             The process table or view from which you want to retrieve
                                                   records, referenced by explicit Process ID or the alias
                                                   THIS_PROCESS.

  •  Example
  Example  1 (subquery in the AVG function):
    SELECT  "City"  AS  "Sales  Region",
        AVG (
              (SELECT  LAST("end_time")    - FIRST("end_time"))
         ) AS "AVG  Cycle   Time
    FROM  THIS PROCESS
    ORDER  BY 2  ASC
  This query returns the average cycle time per city.

  .& Example
  Example  2 (subquery in the SUM function):
    SELECT  SUM(
         (SELECT  SUM(IF("event_name"     =  'T-shirt  Printed',   1,  0))))
    FROM  THIS PROCESS
  This query maps a number to an event and sums the numbers up to count the number of occurrences of
  this event.

  .® Example
  Example  3 (subquery in the FROM clause):
    SELECT  "City"  AS  City,  "C"  AS  "Cases",  C  / 877  * 100  AS  "Percentage"
    FROM  (
         SELECT  "City",  COUNT   (1) AS  "C"

1.3.1    SELECT        DISTINCT         clause
Learn about the SELECT (DISTINCT)  clause in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio
Process Intelligence.
The SELECT  DISTINCT  clause returns unique values of a specified column. If NULL values are present, they are
included. This function is not supported in subqueries.
Syntax:
  SELECT  DISTINCT   expression
 FROM   table
 Parameter                                          Description
 expression                                         The column, expression, or event-attribute that is returned.

Example 2: Get unique event name sequences (variants) in your process
  SELECT  DISTINCT   event_name   AS  "Event  Name:"
 FROM   THISPROCESS
This query returns all unique event name sequences (also referred to as variants) from the event name column
in the default process view. Using AS "Event Name:" assigns a column alias to the result. The query is executed
at the case level which means that the event name sequences are represented as nested lists of event names.
Duplicate values are removed from the result set so that every event name sequence (nested list) only appears
once.

Example 3: Get only unique event names in your process
  SELECT DISTINCT  event_name AS  "Event Name:"
 FROM  FLATTEN  (THIS_PROCESS)
 ORDER  BY 1 ASC
This query returns a unique list of event names in ascending order. Using AS "Event Name:" assigns a column
alias to the result. Using the FLATTEN expression flattens the nested event data in the process, thereby
representing each nested event as a single row containing case and event properties. Duplicate values are then
removed from the result set so that every event name only appears once.

                                                     select.
Following are the common symbols  used in WHERE  clause:
 Symbols
 > (greater than)
 < (less than)
 >= (greater than or equal to)
 <= (less than or equal to)
 = (equal to)
 != (not equal to)
Example  1: Get the total purchase order amount
To retrieve the total order amount from the purchases made in the Boston city. This query retrieves the Order
Amount  column  values that match the WHERE condition.
  SELECT  SUM("ORDER    AMOUNT")
  FROM  THIS  PROCESS
 WHERE("City"='Boston')
This query returns the total order amount in Boston as 94,757.15.
Example  2: Using AND in the WHERE clause
To get the list of case Ids of the orders from Miami city with order status as delivered, run the following query.
  SELECT  case_id,"City",     "Order   Status"
  FROM  THISPROCESS
 WHERE("ORDER     Status"='Delivered'     AND   "City"='Miami')
The query returns the following result.

The following query finds the duration between two events: first receipt of an order and completion of payment
for that order. It does this by executing a subquery, querying event-level data. In obtaining the timestamp of the
final payment, only events named 'Receive Payment' are included by the filter. Because an order may include
multiple payments, LAST is applied to the resulting aggregation to obtain the latest timestamp.
                                                                              SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide

the two timestamps gives the cycle time from order receipt to payment.

1.3.5    GROUP        BY   clause
Learn about the GROUP BY clause in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
The GROUP  BY clause is used to group the result of a SELECT statement by the expressions at the specified
indices. For example, GROUP BY 1, 2 groups the result by the first and second expression. All rows that share
the same values for the grouped expressions are condensed into a single row.
The GROUP  BY clause is often used with aggregate functions, for example COUNT, MAX, MIN, and AVG. Read
more in section Aggregate functions [page 66]. An aggregate function is computed across all rows of each
group and returns a separate value for each group.
The GROUP  BY clause is optional. If the GROUP BY clause is not present, then the following applies:
    If there are aggregate and non-aggregate expressions in the SELECT statement, then the result is
    automatically grouped by any non-aggregate expressions.
    If there are only aggregate expressions in the SELECT statement, then the result is a single group
    comprising all the selected rows.

function.
If the GROUP  BY clause is present, then the following applies:
    You must  group by all expressions in the SELECT statement that are not encapsulated by an aggregate
    function. Exception: The ungrouped expression is functionally dependent from a grouped expression (see
    example  2 below).
    You can't group by an expression that contains an aggregate function.

                                                      The expression relates either to a case-level attribute, for
                                                      example "city", or to an event-level attribute, for example
                                                      "event-name". In the first case, the result is grouped by cit-
                                                      ies. In the second case, the result is grouped by the list of
                                                      identical sequences of events. This can be used to identify

Example  1: Case with GROUP  BY on multiple columns
  SELECT   city,  region,   COUNT(case_id)
  FROM  THIS  PROCESS
  GROUP  BY  1,  2
GROUP   BY  1, 2 groups by the expressions in the SELECT statement which  are not encapsulated by an
aggregation function. Since this SELECT statement contains two expressions (city and region),  the GROUP
BY  index must refer to both expressions. GROUP BY 1 or GROUP  BY 2 is not valid in this case.
Example  2: Case with GROUP  BY
To get the count of case ids with actual order amounts and order amounts multiplied 2.50 times, run the
following query.
  SELECT   "Order  Amount",    ("Order   Amount"*2.50)     AS  "Orders",   COUNT(case_id)     AS
  "No.of  Cases"

Since the second expression order_amount*2. 50 is functionally dependent to the first colum
order_amount,  GROUP  BY  1 is valid in this case.
The query returns the following result.

1.3.11    FLATTEN         operator

Learn about the FLATTEN operator in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
The FLATTEN  operator flattens the nested table with the event attributes in a way that each event attribute
becomes  a top-level row. Case attributes are repeated accordingly.
Do not combine the FLATTEN operator with the MATCHES operators. The MATCHES operators work only for
nested tables and not for flattened tables.
Nested table before flattening:
   Case_ID   Customer iD    Status      City                          Events

 tablename                                         The nested table from which you want to retrieve records.
Example 1: Flatten a nested table
  SELECT  case_id,"Customer     ID",  "Order  Status",   "City",  "event_name",    "end_time"
  FROM FLATTEN   (THIS_PROCESS)
This query creates a flattened table (see flattened table above) that allows further aggregations on event
attribute-level.
Example 2: Count number of cases that include a specific event
  SELECT  COUNT  (DISTINCT   case_id),   "event_name"
  FROM FLATTEN   (THIS_PROCESS)
  GROUP  BY 2
This query returns the total number of cases in which each event occurs.

SELECT  statements  before and after UNION ALL can only have the following clauses:

  SELECT  expressions
  FROM  table
  [TABLESAMPLE]
  [WHERE]
  [GROUP  BY]

Any other clauses, for example the UNION ALL, ORDER  BY, FILL, LIMIT, and OFFSET are applied to the result of
UNION  ALL.

Example  1:

  SELECT  case_id   AS  "Case   ID"

Operator     Precedence
These operators follow the standard mathematical order of operations. This means:
    Evaluation proceeds from left to right. For example, 9 - 5 + 2 is interpreted as (9 - 5) + 2 = 6 rather than 9 -
    (5 + 2) = 2.
    Evaluation is performed in order of precedence (from higher to lower). For example, 5 + 2 * 2 is interpreted
    as 5 + (2 * 2) = 9 rather than (5 + 2) * 2 = 14.

1.4.3    Logical    Expressions
Learn about the available logical expressions in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio

The following logical operators are available:
 Operator                                     Description
 AND                                          True if all the expressions separated by AND are true.
 NOT                                          Negates the expression.
 OR                                           True if any of the expressions separated by OR is true.

 expression2                                          The second expression to be evaluted.
Operator Precedence
These two operators have different operator precedence. Specifically, AND takes precedence over OR. In
compound   expressions including both operators, this means that AND operations are evaluated before OR
operations. For example, A OR B  AND  C is interpreted as A OR (B AND  C) by default.
To override this and force OR operations to take precedence, enclose the relevant part of the expression in
parentheses, for example, (A OR  B)  AND  C.

NOT
NOT(expression1)
 Parameters                                           Description

1.4.5     LIKE    and   ILIKE     Expressions

Learn about the LIKE and ILIKE expression in SIGNAL.With LIKE and ILIKE expressions, you can search for a
specified string pattern in a column.
Using LIKE and ILIKE expressions, you can search for a specified string pattern in a column with string data
type. The LIKE expression matches case-sensitive string patterns, whereas the ILIKE expression matches
case-insensitive string patterns.

SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
SAP Signavio Analytics Language                                                        PUBLIC   51
Z     ZBoth of these expressions provide:
    flexible string comparison using special characters
    improved  string filtering and bucketing
    flexible process variant filtering using MATCHES and BEHAVIOR  MATCHES   expressions
An optional keyword 'NOT' can be used  along with LIKE and ILIKE expressions to search for the non-matching
string patterns.

Syntax

  <expression>     [NOT]  LIKE   <pattern>
  <expression>     [NOT]  ILIKE   <pattern>
 Parameter                                             Description
 expression                                            The string expression that is compared with the defined
                                                       pattern.
 pattern                                               The defined string pattern the expression is compared with.
                                                       The string pattern includes special characters percent (%)
                                                       and underscore (_) to conduct a character-by-character
                                                       comparison.
 NOT                                                   An optional keyword that is used to negate the expression
                                                       matching.
The LIKE and  ILIKE expressions take string as input and return boolean as output.
For example:
 Expression                                            Output
 'Amsterdam' LIKE 'A%'                                 true
 'Ibiza' ILIKE '%A'                                    true
 'Boston' NOT LIKE 'B%'                                false
 'Miami' NOT ILIKE '%l'                                false


Special    Characters
The LIKE and  ILIKE expressions use special characters to compare strings, character-by-character.
The following special characters can be used in conjunction with these expressions:
    The  percent (%) wildcard represents zero, one, or multiple characters

                                                                                  SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
52     PUBLIC                                                                        SAP Signavio Analytics Language    The  underscore (_) wildcard represents one, single character
    The  backslash (\) character represents the escape character
You can also combine  these special characters in a pattern.
 Special characters usage                              Description
 ILIKE  '%to%'                                          Returns true if the matching string pattern contains "to" in

 LIKE  '_o%'                                            Returns true if the matching string pattern contains "o" in
                                                       the second position
                                                        Example: "Boston", "Rostock"
 ILIKE  'm  %'                                         Returns true if the matching string pattern starts with "m" or
                                                        "M" and is at least 3 characters in length
                                                        Example: "Miami", "Munich"
 ILIKE  'b%n'                                           Returns true if the matching string pattern starts with "b" or
                                                        "B", and ends with "n" or "N"
                                                        Example: "Berlin", "bern", "Boston"

LIKE   and    ILIKE   Expressions      with    MATCHES
You can also use the LIKE and ILIKE expressions with MATCHES   and BEHAVIOR    MATCHES   expressions for
filtering nested data. For example, see Example 3 [page 54] and Example 4 [page 54].

Example      1

Learn about the CASE WHEN   expression in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio
Process Intelligence.
This section provides you with the following conditional expressions:
    CASE  WHEN   expression [page 56]
    IF expression [page 59]


CASE    WHEN      expression

The CASE  WHEN   expression evaluates a list of conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met.
Once  a condition is true, it stops reading and returns the result. If no conditions are true, it returns the value in
the ELSE clause. If the ELSE clause is not present, it returns a NULL value.
Each CASE  statement must  end with the END statement. The ELSE statement is optional, and provides a way
to capture values not specified in the WHEN/THEN statements.
The WHEN   statement is evaluated in the following ways:
    If a match is found, then the corresponding result in the THEN statement is returned, and the evaluation
    stops. Any further WHEN statements  aren't evaluated.
    If no match is found and an ELSE statement is present in the expression, then the result in the ELSE
    statement is returned.
    If no match is found, and no ELSE statement is present, then a NULL value is returned.


Syntax

  CASE
       WHEN  condition   1  THEN  result   1

IF  expression
The IF expression evaluates a single condition and return values based on the defined parameters. You need to
provide two parameters,  one for true and one for false.
    If the condition evaluates to true, the expression returns the desired value.
    If the condition evaluates to false, the expression returns a different value.
The values returned can  be literals, column attributes or the results of other expressions, such as additional IF
expressions.


Syntax
IF(condition,     valueIfTrue,     valueIfFalse)

Nested     IF
IF expressions that contain additional IF expressions as value_if_true or value_if_false are called nested IF
expressions. Either or both of the possible return values, value_if_true and value_if_false, can be another IF
expression. The  number  of nested IF expressions is limited to 256.

Examples
Following are the examples  of simple IF and nested IF.

Example      with   simple     IF
The following example  returns a distinct list of cities along with an associated state. The IF expression is used
to compare  the City to a literal value 'San Francisco'. If the City name matches the defined condition, the
state value is returned as 'California'. If the city does not match the defined condition, then the state value is
returned as 'Other'.

1.4.9.1.1          Linear      Regression         Functions

Learn about the Linear regression in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
With the linear regression functions, you can calculate the relationship between two variables using the least
squares regression method, which is a standard approach for calculating a linear relationship. The least
squares regression line, also called the line of best fit, can be visualized as a straight line drawn through a set of
data points that represents the relationship between them.
For the regression line calculation, you need two parameters, slope and intercept. The slope and intercept
show  how two variables are related according to an average rate of change, which works well with scatter plots
because scatter plots show two variables. The regression line is plotted on a scatter plot of the same data to
show the general data trend.
The purpose of the linear regression function is to find the relationship between the explanatory variable, X,
and the dependent variable, Y. It predicts the value of Y when the value of X is known.

                                                                              SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
66    PUBLIC                                                                     SAP Signavio Analytics LanguageWhere     to Use   Linear    Regression
    The primary purpose  of the linear regression function is to facilitate the plotting of regression lines in
    Correlation widget.
    You can also use the linear regression function within custom SQL statements to calculate trend or
    regression values. This is useful for making predictions that extend beyond the provided data. For example,
    suppose  that order value is plotted against quantity and you want to know the value of an order size that is
    10 times the maximum   order size within your dataset.

Linear    Regression      Formula    and   Functions
A linear regression line has an equation of the form: �= a + bx
x is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable.
a = intercept (the value of Y when X = 0) and b = slope.
Following are the two functions implemented to support the linear regression:
    regr_slope(Y, X) function: slope of the least-squares-fit linear equation determined by the (X, Y) pairs
    regr_intercept(Y, X) function: Y-intercept of the least-squares-fit linear equation determined by the (X, Y)
    pairs
The slope indicates the steepness of the regression line, whereas the intercept indicates its intersection with
the Y axis. The Y-intercept is the point at which the graph intersects the Y-axis. Based on the slope of each
X-axis unit, the subsequent point on the Y-axis is determined.

Syntax

  REGR_INTERCEPT(<yAttribute>,        <xAttribute>)
  REGR_SLOPE  (<yAttribute>,     <xAttribute>)
 Parameter                          Description                        Valid Types
 yAttribute                         Y is the dependent variable and is plot- Number
                                    ted along the Y axis of a scatterplot.
 xAttribute                         X is the explanatory variable and is plot- Number
                                    ted along the X axis of a scatterplot.
Returns: A Number,  the intercept of the univariate linear regression line determined by the (X, Y) pairs.

1.4.9.1.14       STDDEV

Calculates the standard deviation for a collection of values.
The standard deviation describes the average deviation of all measured values from the mean value. A low
standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean value. A high standard deviation
indicates that the values are spread out over a wide range.


Syntax

  STDDEV(<expression>)

Example     2


This query shows how the cycle time of a process changes week-to-week. Specifically, it calculates both the
average and the standard deviation of the cycle time on a weekly basis.
To smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data, it uses windowed versions of the average (AVG) and
standard deviation (STDDEV) functions. These versions calculate a moving average and moving standard
deviation for the weekly mean cycle time respectively.
In the nested query, sq1, all cases are clustered together by week. The mean cycle time within each cluster is
calculated.
The outer query applies the windowed AVG and STDDEV functions to the weekly mean cycle time. In both cases,
the window includes the three weeks preceding and the three weeks following the current week.

                             DAY_MTWT_S')

Returns: The difference between timestampStart and timestampEnd as a Duration.




Example


The query below demonstrates how the choice of weekday calendar affects calculated durations.

Three pairs of timestamps are selected. For each pair, the duration field, calculated without reference to
working time, displays the simple time difference. Each subsequent column shows how the original time
difference changes when taking into account a different weekday calendar.

Returns the current UTC timestamp.
What  is UTC?
UTC  is Coordinated Universal Time, the main standard by which clocks are globally synchronized.
A UTC timestamp  represents time measured at 0° longitude. All time zones are offset from UTC to calculate
local time. For example, Central European Time (CET) is UTC+1. A local time of 09:00 CET would be 08:00
UTC.
UTC  does not change with seasons and is not affected by daylight saving. Therefore, Central European
Summer  Time (CEST) is UTC+2. A local time of 10:00 CEST would be 08:00 UTC.

Syntax
NOW ()
Returns: A Timestamp corresponding to the date and time at which the query is executed.

Example
In the following example, the output of the call to NOw becomes the expression parameter value for
DATE_PART.  The result displays the current quarter at the time the query is executed.
  SELECT
      NOW () ,
      DATE_PART('quarter',     NOW())  as  "current_quarter"

Returns: A String, the result of appending expression2 to expression1.
Alternative syntax, which allows concatenation of an arbitrary number of strings:
 <expression1>     || <expression2>     [ || <expressionN>      ... ]

Example     (Non-nested      Attributes)
This query concatenates a dash to the name of every event which features the string 'ship'. It then uses the
output of that call as a parameter to a second call to CONCAT, appending the carrier name.

1.4.9.6         Window        Functions

Learn about window functions in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
This section explains the window functions that you can use in your SIGNAL queries.
Window  functions are aggregate-like functions that you can perform over a selection of the rows which are
selected by a query. You can use window functions to perform calculations on a set of table rows that are
related to the current row in a table. In window functions, each row remains separate to the query output.
Window  functions have access to all the rows that are part of the current row's group which is determined by
the PARTITION  BY list of the window function.
Below  is the general form of a window function: {aggregation function} OVER   ([PARTITION   BY
 {partition   expressions}]    [ORDER  BY  {order   expressions}]    [[ROWS |   RANGE]  BETWEEN
 {window  frame}])
    The {aggregation function} is the function which groups the values of multiple rows to create a single
    summary  value.
    The ORDER   BY clause sorts the data set in the PARTITION BY clause in ascending or descending order.
    The PARTITION  BY clause is a subclause of the OVER clause and groups a data set into partitions.
    ROWS|RANGE    modes  define the scope of the {window frame}.
    The {window frame} is the set of rows related to the current row where the window function is used to
    calculate the values of the defined window. You can define the window frame by using the ROW and RANGE
    modes.


Limitations

Below is a list of current limitations that apply while using window functions in SIGNAL queries:
    Window  functions can only be used on flat data, not on event level or nested data.

SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide
SAP Signavio Analytics Language                                                             PUBLIC   105    You can't create an empty window frame when using window functions. The following are examples of
    empty window frames:
        ROWS  BETWEEN  1 PRECEDING  AND 2 PRECEDING
        ROWS  BETWEEN  1 FOLLOWING  AND  1 PRECEDING
        ROWS  BETWEEN  1 FOLLOWING  AND  CURRENT  ROW



Considerations

Below is a list of considerations when using window functions in SIGNAL queries:
    Window functions are evaluated after aggregate functions in a SELECT clause.
    Window functions can only occur in SELECT clauses and on flat data. Nested data structures aren't
    supported. If you have a nested data structure like an event log, you can use window functions on case
    level. If you want to use window functions on event level you can use the FLATTEN operator to create a flat
    table and then use PARTITION BY case_id.
    In ORDER BY clauses, only use expressions such as column names and not numeric values for indices.


Functions

In window functions you can use aggregate and non-aggregate functions.


Aggregate     functions

You can use the following aggregate functions:
    SUM
    COUNT
    MIN
    MAX
    AVG
    FIRST
    LAST
    BOOL_OR
    BOOL_AND
For more information, see Aggregate functions [page 66].

You can use the following non-aggregate functions:
    LAG
    LEAD
    ROW_NUMBER

1.4.9.6.3          Window        Frame
Learn about window functions in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
The window frame is the set of rows related to the current row where the window function is used to calculate
the values of the defined window. You can define the window frame by using the ROW and RANGE modes.
The window frame contains a frame_start and a frame_end. These frames are the start and end of your
window frame.
In the frame_start you can add the following keywords:
    CURRENT   ROW
    UNBOUND   PRECEDING
    offset PRECEDING
In the frame_end you can add the following keywords:
    CURRENT   ROW
    UNBOUNDED    FOLLOWING
    offset FOLLOWING
The frame_start of CURRENT  ROW  means the frame starts with the current row's first peer row (a row that the
window's ORDER  BY clause sorts as equivalent to the current row). The frame_end of CURRENT ROW means
the frame ends with the current row's last peer row.
The UNBOUNDED    keyword is the first or last row of the peer group with the partition.
The offset expression's data type can vary depending on the data type of the ordering column. If you use
numeric ordering columns, the type is the same as the ordering column.
If the ordering column is of the type timestamp ('10 days'), you can have the following RANGE BETWEEN '1 day'
PRECEDING   AND '10 days' FOLLOWING. The offset expression must be a non-null and non-negative value.




                                                                            SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide

With the ROWS mode, you can define the start and end of the window frame in terms of rows relevant to the
current row. You can define the window frame with the ROWS mode in following ways:
    ROWS  BETWEEN   10 PRECEDING  AND  CURRENT  ROW
    ROWS  BETWEEN   10 PRECEDING  AND 10 FOLLOWING
    ROWS  BETWEEN   UNBOUNDED    PRECEDING  AND  UNBOUNDED    FOLLOWING
The UNBOUNDED    keyword refers to the first or last row in a column or partition.
    UNBOUNDED    PRECEDING  is the first row
    UNBOUNDED    FOLLOWING  is the last row
If there is no ORDER BY clause, the returned results are undefined and the order in which the rows are
processed isn't uniform.
An offset of O refers to the current row.
Syntax:
  SELECT  column  name,  SUM(column   name)
  OVER  (ORDER  BY column  name  ASC  ROWS  BETWEEN  1  PRECEDING  AND  1 FOLLOWING)
 Parameter                                        Description

With the RANGE mode, you can define where the window frame starts and ends in window functions. When
using the RANGE keyword the ORDER BY clause is required and you must specify one column name by which
the window frame is ordered. Using the RANGE keyword is useful when working time series and when there are
many  gaps or duplicate data in your tables.
With the RANGE keyword, you can define the window frame by the maximum difference between the value of
the column in the current row and its value in the preceding or following rows of the scope.
The RANGE  mode  only works with data types that are of the type interval, which are numbers and timestamps.
Choice and Boolean data types aren't supported.
You can define the window frame with the RANGE mode in the following ways:
    ORDER  BY attr RANGE BETWEEN  10 PRECEDING  AND  CURRENT   ROW
    ORDER  BY attr RANGE BETWEEN  1.0 PRECEDING  AND 1.0 FOLLOWING
    ORDER  BY attr RANGE BETWEEN  DURATION   "1day" PRECEDING AND  DURATION  "1hour" FOLLOWING
    ORDER  BY attr RANGE BETWEEN  UNBOUNDED    PRECEDING  AND  UNBOUNDED    FOLLOWING

Example     2

This query shows how the cycle time of a process changes week-to-week. Specifically, it calculates both the
average and the standard deviation of the cycle time on a weekly basis.
To smooth out short-term fluctuations in the data, it uses windowed versions of the average (AVG) and
standard deviation (STDDEV) functions. These versions calculate a moving average and moving standard
deviation for the weekly mean cycle time respectively.
In the nested query, sq1, all cases are clustered together by week. The mean cycle time within each cluster is
calculated.

This query partitions data by case ID, sorting each partition chronologically. Each row includes the case ID and
event name along with two additional columns:
    The event name from the next row
    The difference between the timestamps of the current and succeeding rows
The result shows the name of each event that occurred, the name of the succeeding event and how much time
separates the two events. For events having no successor, a null value is displayed.

1.4.9.6.6          Ranking       Functions
The functions in this section are window functions that sort data partitions and assign a rank value for each row
within a result set.
Using these functions, you can filter the results and sort them for consistent stacking in visualizations such as
stacked bar charts.
                                                                            SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide

    ROW_NUMBER():    Returns sequential row numbers.
    RANK(): Returns the rank for each row in a partition, with gaps in the ranking values.
    DENSE_RANK():   Returns the rank for each row in a partition, with no gaps in the ranking values.


1.4.9.6.6.1       DENSE_RANK

Returns the rank of each row in a result set based on the order defined in the OVER clause for each partition
The DENSE_RANK    function assigns the same ranking for rows with identical values and doesn't skip the rank
positions for these identical rows. For example, rows with rank values, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4. The rank value of the next
nonidentical row will have the succeeding rank.


Syntax

  DENSE  RANK () OVER   (
       [ PARTITION   BY  <expression>    [, <expression>,      ...] ]
       [ ORDER  BY  <expression>    [ {  ASC |  DESC  }  ] [,  <expression>,    ...]  ]
  )
 Parameters                                         Description
 expression                                         The column or argument determining how the rows are
                                                    grouped and how each partition is sorted. Mandatory if PAR-
                                                    TITION BY or ORDER BY clauses are included in the query.
PARTITION  BY: Splits the result set into partitions. Optional.
ORDER   BY: Sorts each partition based on the defined criteria. Optional. If ORDER BY clause isn't included in
your query, each row will have the same rank value, one.
ASC  | DESC: ASC sorts the result set in ascending order and DESC sorts it in descending order based on the
expressions defined in ORDER BY.


Example     1

In the following query, the cities are first partitioned by the type of good and sorted by the count of high value
orders per Type of Goods. The query then returns the cities with order amount greater than 1500 ranked in
descending order.

1.4.9.6.6.2         RANK

Returns  the rank of each row in a result set based on the order defined in the OVER clause for each partition.
The  RANK  function assigns the same  ranking for rows with identical values and skips the rank positions for
these identical rows. For example, rows with rank values, 1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 6. The rank value of the next nonidentical
row depends   on the number  of rows with same ranking. The number   of rows with the same ranking determines
the number  of rank values to be skipped.

1.4.9.6.6.3        ROW_NUMBER
Returns the calculated row number based on partitioned and sorted set of values.
The ranking happens sequentially based on the order defined in the OVER clause for each partition. The rank
value is different even if the rows contain the same values.

Syntax
  ROW_NUMBER  () OVER   (
       [ PARTITION   BY  <expression>    [, <expression>,    ...]  ]
       [ ORDER  BY  expression   [  { ASC  | DESC  }  ] [,  <expression>,    ...]  ]

Learn about the BUCKET()  function in SIGNAL, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
The BUCKET()   function calculates the indexes of values in a range of values (as buckets) that are equal in
size. The bucket indexes can then be applied to an aggregate function, for example a COUNT() function, which
counts the values within that bucket.
The BUCKET()   function uses following parameters to calculate the bucket indexes as a positive integer
number:
    The value to be bucketed (expression)
    The minimum   value within the result range (min)
    The fixed width for each bucket (bucket_width)
    The total number of consecutive, non-overlapping buckets (#_inlier_buckets)
Syntax:
BUCKET(expression,     min,   bucket_width,    #_inlier_buckets)

 Parameter                                           Description
 expression                                          Specify a column with numeric or duration values in the
                                                     expression.
 min                                                 The starting value of the bucket. The values must be either
                                                     numeric or duration values.
 bucket_width                                        The width of the bucket. The value must be either a positive
                                                     numeric or positive duration [page 5] that is greater than
                                                     zero.
 #_inlier_buckets                                    The number of required buckets. The value must be a posi-
                                                     tive integer that is greater than or equal to one.
To understand the range of values in the bucket, you can first determine the bucket boundaries and then apply
the boundaries to the BUCKET() function. To determine the bucket boundaries and then apply the boundaries
to the BUCKET() function, use the following pattern:
  SELECT
  IF  (b =  0, NULL,   ((b -  1)  * bucket_width)    +  min)  AS  bucket_start,
  IF  (b =  #_inlier_buckets    +  1,  NULL,  (b  * bucket_width)    +  min)  AS  bucket_end,
  value
  FROM  (
  SELECT  BUCKET(expression,      bucket_start,    bucket_width,    #_inlier_buckets)     AS  b,
  COUNT(1)   AS value
 FROM
  ) AS  sub
The bucket boundaries pattern isn't required for the BUCKET() function to work. It provides a useful way to
understand the range of values in the bucket. The pattern defines the minimum and maximum values being
aggregated in the bucket.
Example  1:
The following example calculates the bucket boundaries (bucket_start and bucket_end). Then aggregates the
total number of cases based on 'Order Amount'. The cases are bucketed into intervals of 100€ (bucket_width).

(min) and less than 10001€ (max). The maximum value is calculated with the following formula: min + bucket
width x #_inlier_buckets = 1+ 100 x 100 = 10001.
  SELECT
  total_cases,
  bucket_id,
  IF (bucket_id   > 100,  -1,  ((bucket_id-1)    * 100)  +  0) AS  bucket_start,

Example 2:
The following example aggregates the total number of cases based on the 'Order Amount'. The cases are
bucketed into intervals of 100€ (bucket_width). The results are calculated for 10 buckets (#_inlier_buckets)
where the 'Order Amount' is greater than 1€ (min) and less than 1001€ (max). The maximum value is
calculated with the following formula: min + bucket width x #_inlier_buckets = 1 + 100 x 10 = 1001
The result displays in a breakdown widget. The values on the X axis represent the bucket ID. Buckets that
contain at least one case within them are displayed. The cases that have a bucket value of 10 but exceed the
maximum   value are added into the outlier bucket. The outlier bucket has a bucket ID of 11.

Learn about  using SIGNAL  in the following tutorial, the process mining query language of SAP Signavio Process
Intelligence.
This tutorial supports you to get started with SIGNAL.
Based  on a sample  process with test data, this tutorial introduces you to the main principles of SIGNAL,
starting from simple case-attribute based  queries to more complex  event-based   queries.
The tutorial is structured as follows:

Read   about   the  overview     of case  attributes    used  in the   SIGNAL    tutorial.

You  want   to get  an  overview    about    the case   attributes   of the   process:   How    many    cases   exist for  this process?
How    many   different   cities  are involved    in this process?     How   many    cases   exist  for each   city?  How   many    cases
exist  for New   York   and  Miami?




Example          1:  How      many       cases      exist     for    this    process?


Learning    success:    Count    a case  attribute.

Query    instruction:   Count    (keyword:    COUNT)      all cases   (expression:    case_id)   in this  process.

SIGNAL     syntax:

  SELECT
  COUNT    (case_id)
  FROM     THIS_PROCESS

Query    result: The   total  number     of cases,  displayed    in a  Value  widget.

Learning success:
    Count two or more case attributes.
    Rename case attribute names with alias names.
    Sort the result set.
Query instruction: Count (keyword: COUNT) the number of cases (expression: case id) by city (expression:
City). Rename the case attribute names with aliases (keyword: AS) to "Case Number" and "Site". This makes
labels for widgets easier to understand. Finally sort the result set by Case numbers (keywords: ORDER BY 1) in
descending order (keyword: DESC).
The order expression 1 selects the column, which has to be sorted. You can sort in ascending order (keyword:
ASC), descending order (keyword: DESC), by null values first (keyword: NULLS FIRST,) or by null values last
(keyword: NULLS LAST).
SIGNAL  syntax:

Learning success:
    Calculate cycle times
    Perform subqueries on event attributes
Query instruction: You have to calculate the cycle times first and then aggregate them to an average value. The
cycle times are calculated from the event-based timestamps, so you have to perform a subquery (keyword:
(SELECT).
To calculate the cycle time, you have to subtract the first event timestamp (keyword: SELECT FIRST +
expression: end_time) from the last event timestamp (keyword: SELECT LAST + expression: end_time). From
these values, you aggregate the average value (keyword: AVG) .
SIGNAL  syntax:
  SELECT

3.5      Investigate       events
Read about how events of the process are used in the SIGNAL tutorial.
You want to get an overview about the events of the process: How many cases have been closed / canceled?
What is the drop-out rate? How many cases follow the standard process? How many cases are canceled
although the T-shirt has been sent for printing?
Example    1: How   many   cases   have  been   closed  /  canceled?
Learning success: Counting the total number of events.
You perform two subqueries for the last event names and sum up all cases for which the respective condition is
fulfilled. The event names are event-based attributes, so you perform a subquery (keyword: (SELECT).
Select the last events of the cases (keyword: SELECT LAST + expression: event_name).
If (keyword: IF) the last event name is "Receive Delivery Confirmation" (keyword: IN + expression: ('Receive
Delivery Confirmation')) count 1, otherwise 0 (keyword: 1,0)). Sum up (keyword: SUM) the value for all cases.
Rename  the value with an alias(keyword: AS) to "Closed Cases".
                                                                        SAP Signavio Analytics Language Guide

Example    2: What    is the drop-out    rate?


Learning success: Filter for not true conditions.

Query instruction: Select the last events of the cases (keyword: SELECT LAST + expression: event_name).
Filter the result set(keyword: FILTER (WHERE) for event names other than (keyword: NOT) "Receive Delivery
Confirmation" (keyword: IN+ expression: ('Receive Delivery Confirmation')) and calculate the percentage.

Example     3: How    many   cases    follow  the  standard     process?

Learning success: Determine the process conformance.
Query instruction: This query is similar to example 2, but in this case, you do not only search for the first or last
event but for a certain pattern of events.
You query the following pattern:
 1. The starting event is "Receive Customer Order" (expression: ''Receive Customer Order')
 2. The next event (directly or indirectly following the start event) is "Receive Payment" (expression: ->
    'Receive Payment').
 3. The next event (directly or indirectly following the preceding event) is either "Ship Goods Standard" or
    "Ship Goods Express"(expression: ~>('Ship Goods Standard | 'Ship Goods Express')) .
 4. The final event (directly or indirectly following the preceding event) is "Receive Delivery Confirmation"
    (expression: 'Receive Delivery Confirmation'$).
For the conformance to this pattern, you calculate the percentage.
SIGNAL  syntax:
  SELECT
  (COUNT(case_id)    FILTER
  (WHERE  event  name  MATCHES

printing?

Learning success: Determine the process conformance.
Query instruction: This query is similar to example 3, but for a different type of pattern: You want to determine
how many  orders have been canceled while the T-Shirt has already been sent for printing.
You query the following pattern:
 1. The starting event is "Receive Customer Order"(expression: ^'Receive Customer Order')
 2. The next event (directly or indirectly following the start event) is "Receive Payment"(expression: ~>
    'Receive Payment').
 3. The next event (directly or indirectly following the preceding event) is "Send T-shirt to Printing"(expression:
    ~>'Ship T-shirt to Printing') .
 4. The final event (directly or indirectly following the preceding event) is "Order Canceled"(expression: 'Order
    Canceled'$).
For the conformance to this pattern, you calculate the percentage.
SIGNAL  syntax:
  SELECT
  (COUNT(case_id)   FILTER
