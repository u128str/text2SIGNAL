{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and process data from the 'defaultview-197' table. It first creates a temporary table named 'temp' with columns: 'case_id', 'wa' (which is the 'end_time'), 'BillingDocument', 'event_name', 'AVG_ClearingTime', and 'Flag'. The 'AVG_ClearingTime' is calculated as the difference between the 'end_time' and the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Billing Document', grouped by 'BillingDocument'. The 'Flag' column is set to 1 if the 'event_name' starts with 'Reject Billing Request', otherwise it is set to 0. From this temporary table, the query selects rows where 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The final output includes the month of 'wa' as 'Clearing Date', the count of distinct 'BillingDocument' as '#Billing Docs', and the average of 'AVG_ClearingTime' as 'AVG Clearing Time'. The results are ordered by '#Billing Docs' in ascending order.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and process data from the 'defaultview-197' table.
