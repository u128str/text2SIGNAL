{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'. Firstly, it counts the number of cases by counting the 'CASE_ID' column and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the last end time where the event name is 'Create Goods Receipt' from the last end time where the event name is 'Create FI Invoice'. This average is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. The query also selects the column 'PO Item Plant City' and labels it as 'PO Plant City'. The results are then grouped by the third selected column, which is 'PO Plant City'. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order by the first selected column, which is 'No. of Cases'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'.
