{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the 'Automation rate' and display the 'Division' from the table named 'defaultview-183'. The 'Automation rate' is calculated as the percentage of the total count of 'EVENT_NAME' that were not created by a 'Dialog' user type. This is achieved by filtering out 'Event Created By User Type' that are not 'Dialog' and counting the remaining 'EVENT_NAME'. This count is then divided by the total count of 'EVENT_NAME' and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. The query specifically looks for events where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Process Order'. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the 'Automation rate'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the 'Automation rate' and display the 'Division' from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
