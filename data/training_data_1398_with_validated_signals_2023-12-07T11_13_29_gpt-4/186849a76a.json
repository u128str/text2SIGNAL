{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first 'end_time' from the last 'end_time' for each case. This average cycle time is then labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The query also counts the number of 'case_id' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. Additionally, it retrieves the 'PO Vendor Name' and labels it as 'PO Vendor'. The results are ordered in descending order based on the average cycle time. The query limits the output to the top 500 records. Note that there is a commented out WHERE clause which, if active, would filter the data to only include events where the 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Clear Invoice' and the 'EVENT_NAME' follows the sequence 'Create PR Item' to 'Release PR Item'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
