{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to provide a detailed summary of invoice data. It starts by selecting distinct cases from the 'defaultview-225' table where the event name is 'Clear Invoice'. For each distinct case, it retrieves the company code text, vendor number, vendor name, vendor country, and calculates the payment block rate. It also retrieves the accounting document number, converted USD amount, due date, clearing date, posting document date, event creator type, and event name. It calculates the total cycle time and payment block duration. The query then groups these cases by company code text, vendor number, vendor name, and vendor country. It calculates the total invoice amount in USD, the number of invoices, the average payment block rate, the average number of days from posting to the net due date, the percentage of invoices posted automatically, the rework rate, the change rate, the late payment rate, the average payment block duration in days, and the average total cycle time. The final output is a table with columns for vendor number, vendor name, vendor country, company code name, invoice amount in USD, number of invoices, late payment rate in %, average payment block rate in %, average days posting to net due date, automatic invoice posting in %, rework rate in %, change rate in %, average payment block duration in days, and average total cycle time.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to provide a detailed summary of invoice data.
