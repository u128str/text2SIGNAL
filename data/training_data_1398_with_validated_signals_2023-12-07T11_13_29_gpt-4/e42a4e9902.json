{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is calculating a percentage from the 'defaultview-225' table. It first sums up the count of 'case_id' where the 'Event Created By User Type' is either 'System' or 'Service' and the 'event_name' contains 'Post'.

The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
