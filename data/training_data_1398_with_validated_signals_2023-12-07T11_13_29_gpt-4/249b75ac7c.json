{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it truncates the date to the month of the first 'Post Invoice' event by using the 'DATE_TRUNC' and 'FIRST' functions on the 'END_TIME' column. This value is then returned as 'Month'. Secondly, it calculates the sum of the 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' column and returns this total as 'Total Amount (USD) of Invoices'. Thirdly, it calculates the average cycle time between the 'Clear Invoice' and 'Post Invoice' events by subtracting the first 'Post Invoice' event time from the last 'Clear Invoice' event time. This average is returned as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The results are then ordered in ascending order by the 'Month' column, with any null values appearing first. Finally, the 'FILL timeseries' function is used to fill in any missing months in the data.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'.
