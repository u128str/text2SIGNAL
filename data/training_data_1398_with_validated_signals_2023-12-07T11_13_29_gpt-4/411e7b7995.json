{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and analyze project data from the 'defaultview-197' table. It first creates a subquery named 'selection' where it calculates the 'Duration' of each project. The 'Duration' is calculated as the difference between the 'end_time' of the 'Close Project' event and the 'Start Project' event, subtracted by the difference between the 'end_time' of the 'Project Planned End Date passed' event and the 'Start Project' event. The query only considers cases where the 'Duration' is not null. From this subquery, the main query then selects the 'WBSE_ProjectType' as 'Project Type', counts the distinct 'case_id' as the number of projects, and calculates the average, minimum, and maximum 'Duration' as 'AVG Difference', 'MIN Difference', and 'MAX Difference' respectively. The results are then ordered by the second column in descending order, which is the number of projects.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and analyze project data from the 'defaultview-197' table.
