{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to select specific columns from a subquery named SUB3. The columns selected are 'PO Id', 'PO Date', 'PO Material Group', 'Vendor Name', 'PO Item Plant', 'Avg. Cycle Time', 'PO Value (INR)', and 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)'. The subquery SUB3 is derived from another subquery named SUB2, where it filters the data based on conditions such as 'PO Count' being greater than 1, 'PO Value (INR)' being less than 1000000, and 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)' being between 999999 and 1999999. The subquery SUB2 is created from another subquery named SUB1, where it calculates the count of 'PO Id' and the sum of 'PO Value (INR)' for each 'PO Date' and 'PO Material Group'. The subquery SUB1 is created from the table 'defaultview-124', where it groups the data by 'PO Id', 'PO Date', 'PO Material Group', 'Vendor Name', and 'PO Item Plant', and calculates the sum of 'PO Item Net Order Value' and the average cycle time. The final result is ordered by 'PO Date' in descending order, then by 'PO Material Group' and 'Vendor Name'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to select specific columns from a subquery named SUB3.
