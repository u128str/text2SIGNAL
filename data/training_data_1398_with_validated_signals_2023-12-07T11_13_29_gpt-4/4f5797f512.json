{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is calculating the percentage of cases in the table 'defaultview-290' where the event name is either 'Create Return Sales Order Item' or 'Create Returns Delivery'. It does this by first counting the number of cases where the event name matches either of the two specified values. This count is then divided by the total number of cases in the table to get a ratio. This ratio is then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage.
