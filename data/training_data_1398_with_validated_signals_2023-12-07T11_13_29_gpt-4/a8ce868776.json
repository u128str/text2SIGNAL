{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing several operations on the table named 'defaultview-217'. It is calculating the average time difference between different stages of an event. The stages are 'Create Issue', 'Change Status to In Progress', 'Change Status to Ready for Review', 'Change Status to In Review', and 'Change Status to Closed'. The time difference is calculated by subtracting the end time of the first event from the end time of the last event for each stage. The results are then averaged for each stage transition. The first calculation is for the average time from 'Create Issue' to 'Change Status to In Progress'. The second calculation is for the average time from 'Change Status to In Progress' to 'Change Status to Ready for Review'. The third calculation is for the average time from 'Change Status to Ready for Review' to 'Change Status to In Review'. The final calculation is for the average time from 'Change Status to In Review' to 'Change Status to Closed'. The results are returned as four separate columns, each named after the respective stage transition.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing several operations on the table named 'defaultview-217'.
