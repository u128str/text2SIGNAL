{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates two main metrics: 'Late delivery rate' and 'Average delay'. The 'Late delivery rate' is calculated as the percentage of cases where the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date'. This is done by counting the number of cases where the difference between 'Actual Delivery Date' and 'Scheduled Finish Date' is greater than 0 seconds, and then dividing this count by the total number of cases, and multiplying by 100. The 'Average delay' is calculated as the average time difference between 'Actual Delivery Date' and 'Scheduled Finish Date' for cases where the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date'. The query also selects the 'Plant' column from the table. The results are ordered in descending order based on the 'Late delivery rate', and only the top 10 results are returned.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
