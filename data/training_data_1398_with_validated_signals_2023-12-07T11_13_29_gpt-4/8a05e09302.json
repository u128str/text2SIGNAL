{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and summarize data from a table named 'defaultview-124'. The query first selects distinct 'Case Id', 'PO Item Net Order Value' as 'PO Item Value', and calculates 'Total Cycle Time' and 'CYCLE_TIME' based on the difference between the last 'END_TIME' and the first 'END_TIME', and the difference between the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' and the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create PO Item' respectively. This selected data is then used to create a new table, SUB1. In the next step, the query groups the data from SUB1 by 'PO Release Cycle Time Range' and 'Sequence No', which are determined based on the value of 'CYCLE_TIME'. The query also calculates the count of 'Case Id' as 'No. of Cases', the sum of 'PO Item Value' as 'Total PO Amount (INR)', and the average of 'Total Cycle Time' as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. The final output of the query includes 'PO Release Cycle Time Range', 'No. of Cases', 'Total PO Amount (INR)', and 'Avg. Cycle Time' from a new table, SUB2, which is created by ordering the grouped data from SUB1 by 'Sequence No'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and summarize data from a table named 'defaultview-124'.
