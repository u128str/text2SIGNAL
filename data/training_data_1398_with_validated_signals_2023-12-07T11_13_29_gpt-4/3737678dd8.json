{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and process data from the table named 'defaultview-197'. It first creates a temporary table (TEMP) with columns: 'case_id', 'event_name', 'dates', 'Actual_Time', and 'Planned_Time'. The 'dates' column is derived from the 'end_time' column of the original table. The 'Actual_Time' column is calculated as the difference between the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Close Project' and the 'end_time' for each 'case_id'. Similarly, the 'Planned_Time' column is calculated as the difference between the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Project Planned End Date passed' and the 'end_time' for each 'case_id'. After creating the TEMP table, the query filters the rows where 'event_name' is 'Start Project'. Then, it groups the data by the start of each month (derived from the 'dates' column) and calculates the average 'Actual_Time' and 'Planned_Time' for each group. The result is ordered by the 'Start Date' and filled with a time series for each month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and process data from the table named 'defaultview-197'.
