{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It calculates and returns three pieces of information. Firstly, it counts the number of cases, which is determined by the number of 'CASE_ID' in the table. This count is labeled as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the first 'end_time' from the last 'end_time' for each case, and then taking the average of these differences. This result is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. Lastly, it retrieves the 'PO Item Supplier Id' from the table and labels it as 'PO Supplier Id'. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the 'No. of Cases'.
