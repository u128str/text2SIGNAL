{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to categorize and count the number of accounts receivable based on their overdue status. The query is run on the 'defaultview-222' table. It first checks if the 'NetDueDate' column is not null, the 'event_name' column is equal to 'Create Accounts Receivable', the 'ClearingDate' column is null, and the current date is greater than or equal to the 'NetDueDate'. If these conditions are met, it then checks the difference between the current date and the 'NetDueDate'. If the difference is equal to 0 days, it categorizes it as '1. Due'. If the difference is between 1 to 7 days, it categorizes it as '2. 0-7 days'. If the difference is between 8 to 14 days, it categorizes it as '3. 8-14 days'. If the difference is between 15 to 30 days, it categorizes it as '4. 15-30 days'. If the difference is between 31 to 60 days, it categorizes it as '5. 31-60 days'. If the difference is between 61 to 90 days, it categorizes it as '6. 61-90 days'. If the difference is more than 90 days, it categorizes it as '7. >90 days'.
