{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting several columns from a subquery that is derived from the 'defaultview-545' table. The columns selected are 'Company Code Name', 'Vendor Name', '# Cleared Invoices', 'Cleared Amount', 'Late Payment Rate %', 'AVG Net Payment Terms', 'AVG Payment Time', and 'AVG Paid Late Days'. The 'Company Code Name' and 'Vendor Name' are derived from the 'Accounting Company Code' and 'PO Item Supplier ID' columns respectively. The '# Cleared Invoices' and 'Cleared Amount' are calculated by counting distinct 'Last Invoice Id' and summing 'Last Invoice Item Amount' where the event name is 'Pay Invoice'. The 'Late Payment Rate %' is calculated as the percentage of invoices paid late. The 'AVG Net Payment Terms' and 'AVG Payment Time' are calculated as the average difference between 'Last Invoice Due Date' and 'Last Invoice Accounting Date' where the event name is 'Pay Invoice'. The 'AVG Paid Late Days' is calculated as the average difference between 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and 'Last Invoice Due Date' where the event name is 'Pay Invoice' and the difference is greater than 0.
