{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of process orders in each manufacturing plant. It does this by selecting the 'CASE_ID' column from the 'defaultview-183' table, which presumably represents individual process orders. The 'COUNT' function is used to tally up these orders. The result is then labeled as '# Process Orders'. The query also selects the 'Manufacturing Plant' column from the same table, which likely represents the location where each process order is taking place. The 'GROUP BY 2' clause is used to group the results by the second selected column, which in this case is 'Manufacturing Plant'. This means the output will show the number of process orders for each unique manufacturing plant. Finally, the 'ORDER BY 1 DESC' clause sorts the results in descending order based on the first selected column, which is the count of process orders. Therefore, the manufacturing plant with the most process orders will be shown first.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of process orders in each manufacturing plant.
