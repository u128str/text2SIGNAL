{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It first selects the earliest 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is either 'Change Status to Closed' or 'Change Status to To Do', and truncates this date to the month. This is labeled as 'Month when Review completed'. Then, it calculates the average duration between the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Closed' and the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Review'. This average duration is labeled as 'Duration'. The query only considers rows where the 'event_name' transitions from 'Change Status to In Review' to either 'Change Status to To Do' or 'Change Status to Closed'. The results are grouped and ordered by the 'Month when Review completed'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-217'.
