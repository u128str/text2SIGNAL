{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first 'end_time' from the last 'end_time' for each case. This average cycle time is then labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The query also counts the number of 'case_id' and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Additionally, the query retrieves the values from the 'PO Item Plant' column and labels them as 'PO Plant'. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the first column, which is the 'Avg. Cycle time'. The commented out WHERE clause indicates that there might be a need to filter the events based on the 'EVENT_NAME' column, specifically for events that match 'Clear Invoice' and a sequence of events that match 'Create PR Item' followed by 'Release PR Item'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
