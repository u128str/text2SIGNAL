{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing operations on the table named 'defaultview-270'. It calculates the average of two time differences. The first time difference is between the first 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' starts with 'Start' and the 'Routing Step' is '0030', and the first 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' starts with 'Complete' and the 'Routing Step' is '0020'. The second time difference is between the first 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' starts with 'Start' and the 'Routing Step' is '0020', and the first 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' starts with 'Complete' and the 'Routing Step' is '0010'. This average is then returned as 'WIP Time'. Additionally, the query extracts the hour part from the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create SFC' and returns it as 'SFC Creation Time'.
