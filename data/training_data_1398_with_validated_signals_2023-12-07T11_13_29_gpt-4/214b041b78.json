{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting two columns from the table named 'defaultview-545'. The first column is the month of the first 'Create PO Item' event, named as 'PO Creation Date'. This is achieved by truncating the 'end_time' to the month of the first occurrence of the 'Create PO Item' event. The second column is the 'Conformance Rate', which is calculated as the percentage of cases where the event sequence is 'Create PR item', 'Create PO Item', 'Receive PO item', 'Receive Invoice' followed by 'Reconcile Invoice', and finally 'Pay Invoice'. This is calculated by counting the number of cases that match this sequence and dividing it by the total number of cases, then multiplying by 100. The query only considers cases where the event name matches 'Pay Invoice'. The result is ordered by the 'PO Creation Date' in ascending order, with any null values appearing first.
