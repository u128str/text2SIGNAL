{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the percentage of not approved timesheets from the 'defaultview-197' table. It first counts the distinct 'TimesheetRecord' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Timesheet Record'. Then, it subtracts the count of distinct 'TimesheetRecord' where the 'event_name' is either 'Approve Timesheet Record', 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record', or 'Cancel Timesheet Record'. The result of this subtraction is then divided by the total count of distinct 'TimesheetRecord' and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. This percentage is labeled as '% of not Approved Timesheets'. Additionally, the query selects the 'ActivityType' column and labels it as 'Activity Type'. The final result is ordered in descending order based on the first column, which is the calculated percentage of not approved timesheets.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the percentage of not approved timesheets from the 'defaultview-197' table.
