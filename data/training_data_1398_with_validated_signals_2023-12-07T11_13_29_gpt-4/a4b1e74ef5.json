{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting two columns from the table named 'defaultview-124'. The first column is the month of the first 'Create PO Item' event, named as 'PO Creation Date'. This is achieved by truncating the 'end_time' to the month of the first occurrence of the event 'Create PO Item'. The second column is the 'Conformance Rate', calculated as the percentage of cases where the event sequence is 'Create PO Item' followed by 'Release PO', then 'Create Goods Receipt', then either 'Record Invoice Receipt' or 'Create FI Invoice', and finally 'Clear Invoice'. This is done by counting the number of case IDs that match this sequence and dividing it by the total number of case IDs, then multiplying by 100. The query only considers cases where the event name matches 'Clear Invoice'. The result is ordered by the 'PO Creation Date' in ascending order, with any null values appearing first. The query also fills in any missing time series data for the month with null values.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is selecting two columns from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
