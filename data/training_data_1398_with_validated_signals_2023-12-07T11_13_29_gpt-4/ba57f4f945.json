{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the number of active cases per month from the 'defaultview-9' table. It first truncates the 'end_time' column to the month level and assigns a value of 1 to a new column 'started' for the first 'end_time' of each month and 0 for the last 'end_time' of each month. This is done using UNION ALL operation. Then, it groups the data by 'Month' and counts the number of rows where 'started' is 1 (count_started) and where 'started' is 0 (count_finished). The query then calculates the cumulative sum of 'count_started' and 'count_finished' for each month in ascending order. Finally, it selects 'Month' and the difference between 'count_started' and the previous 'count_finished' (if they are not null, otherwise 0) as 'Active Cases'. If there are missing months in the data, it fills them using the TIMESERIES function.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the number of active cases per month from the 'defaultview-9' table.
