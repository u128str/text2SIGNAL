{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-529'. It first selects the last 'END_TIME' for the event named 'Clear Invoice' and truncates this date to the month level, which is then labeled as 'Invoice Clearing Date'. It then calculates the 'Payment Rate' by counting the number of cases where the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date', divided by the total number of cases where the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' is not null, and multiplies the result by 100. The query only considers events where the 'EVENT_NAME' matches the sequence 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'. The output is ordered in ascending order by the 'Invoice Clearing Date', with any null values appearing first.
