{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is calculating a percentage from the 'defaultview-57' table. It first sums up the count of 'PR Id' where 'Event Created By User Type' is either 'System' or 'Service' and the 'event_name' contains 'PR'. This sum is then divided by the total count of 'PR Id' where 'event_name' contains 'PR'. The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
