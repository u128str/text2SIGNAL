{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-471'. It performs two main operations. First, it truncates the date to the month of the first occurrence of the event 'Create PO Item' and labels this as 'PO Creation Date'. Second, it calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the time of the first occurrence of the event 'Create PR Item' from the time of the last occurrence of the event 'Clear Invoice'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Average cycle time'. The query only considers rows where the event name matches the sequence 'Create PR Item' followed by 'Clear Invoice'. The results are ordered in ascending order by the 'PO Creation Date', with any null values appearing first. If there are any gaps in the time series on a monthly basis, these are filled with null values.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-471'.
