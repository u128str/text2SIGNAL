{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-383'. It performs two main operations. First, it selects the last 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Invoice' and truncates this date to the month, labeling it as 'Invoice creation date'. Second, it calculates the 'No Payment Rate' by dividing the count of 'CASE_ID' where the count of 'EVENT_NAME' is greater than 0 and the current time is greater than 'InvoiceDueDate' and 'InvoiceAccountingClearingDate' is null, by the count of 'CASE_ID' where 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Create Invoice'. This result is then multiplied by 100. The output is ordered by the first column in ascending order, with null values appearing first. The query also fills in missing time series data for each month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-383'.
