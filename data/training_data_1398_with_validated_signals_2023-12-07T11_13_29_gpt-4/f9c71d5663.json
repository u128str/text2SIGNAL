{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the percentage of unique cases that have changes in the 'defaultview-383' table. It does this by first counting the distinct 'CASE_ID' where the 'ChangeType' column has a value of 'Update'. This count is then divided by the total number of distinct 'CASE_ID' in the table.
