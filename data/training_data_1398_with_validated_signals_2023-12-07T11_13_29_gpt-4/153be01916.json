{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and process data from the 'defaultview-197' table.

The 'wa' column is derived from the 'end_time' column of the original table.

This temporary table only includes rows where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. From this temporary table, the query then selects the month part of the 'wa' column as 'Clearing Date', the count of distinct 'BillingDocument' as '#Billing Docs', and the average of 'AVG_ClearingTime' as 'AVG Clearing Time'.
