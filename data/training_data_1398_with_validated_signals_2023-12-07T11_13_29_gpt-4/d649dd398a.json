{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the percentage of manually allocated payments in the 'defaultview-222' table. It first creates a temporary table named 'temp' with columns 'times', 'event_name', 'ARUniqueKey', and 'AutomationFlag' from the 'defaultview-222' table. In this temporary table, the 'end_time' column is renamed as 'times'. Then, from this 'temp' table, it selects the month from the 'times' column and calculates the percentage of manually allocated payments. The percentage is calculated as the count of distinct 'ARUniqueKey' where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and 'AutomationFlag' is not 'X', divided by the count of distinct 'ARUniqueKey' where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. This result is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. The query only considers rows where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The final result is ordered by the month in ascending order.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the percentage of manually allocated payments in the 'defaultview-222' table.
