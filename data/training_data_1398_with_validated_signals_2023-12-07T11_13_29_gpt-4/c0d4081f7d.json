{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting several columns from a subquery that is derived from the 'defaultview-197' table. The columns selected include 'Customer Number', 'Customer', 'Number of Projects', 'Number of Cleared Receivables', 'Cleared Amount', 'Late Payment Rate % (rounded)', 'Average Net Payment Terms', 'Average Payment Time', and 'Average Paid Late Days'. The 'Customer Number' is directly taken from the 'AR_Customer' column. The 'Customer' column is derived from the 'AR_CustomerName' column of the 'defaultview-197' table. The 'Number of Projects' is calculated by counting distinct 'case_id'. The 'Number of Cleared Receivables' and 'Cleared Amount' are calculated by counting and summing respectively the 'ARUniqueKey' and 'AmountInCompanyCodeCurrency' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The 'Late Payment Rate %' is calculated by dividing the count of 'ARUniqueKey' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and the difference between 'ClearingDate' and 'NetDueDate' is more than 1 day by the count of 'ARUniqueKey' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable', and then multiplying by 100. This value is then rounded to the nearest whole number. The 'Average Net Payment Terms', 'Average Payment Time', and 'Average Paid Late Days' are calculated by averaging the difference between 'NetDueDate' and 'DocumentDate', 'ClearingDate' and 'DocumentDate', and 'ClearingDate' and 'NetDueDate' respectively where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The 'Average Paid Late Days' is set to NULL if the average difference between 'ClearingDate' and 'NetDueDate' is less than 0.
