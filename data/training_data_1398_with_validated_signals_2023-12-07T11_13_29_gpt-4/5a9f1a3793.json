{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to select specific columns from a table named 'defaultview-124'. The columns selected are 'PO Id', 'PO Date', 'PO Material Group', 'Vendor Name', 'Avg. Cycle Time', 'PO Value (INR)', and 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)'. The 'PO Date' is derived from the 'PO Creation Date' column, truncated to the day. The 'PO Material Group' and 'Vendor Name' are derived from the 'PO Item Material Group Text' and 'PO Vendor Name' columns respectively. The 'PO Value (INR)' is the sum of the 'PO Item Net Order Value' column. The 'Avg. Cycle Time' is calculated as the average difference between the first and last 'END_TIME'. The 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)' is the sum of the 'PO Value (INR)' column. The query also includes a count of 'PO Id' for each combination of 'PO Date', 'PO Material Group', and 'Vendor Name'. The query then filters the results to include only those rows where the 'PO Count' is greater than 1, the 'PO Value (INR)' is less than 1,000,000, and the 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)' is between 1,000,000 and 1,999,999. The results are then ordered by 'Total Purchase Amount (INR)' in descending order and 'PO Date' in descending order. Finally, the query filters the results again to include only those rows where the 'Qualified PO Count' is equal to the 'PO Count'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to select specific columns from a table named 'defaultview-124'.
