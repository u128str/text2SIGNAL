{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing a series of calculations on the 'defaultview-217' table. It calculates the average time taken for different stages in a process, expressed as a percentage of the total time from 'Create Issue' to 'Change Status to Closed'. The stages are 'Create => In Progress', 'In Progress => Ready for Review', 'Ready for Review => In Review', and 'In Review => Closed'. For each stage, it finds the difference between the last 'end_time' when the 'event_name' was the end of the current stage and the first 'end_time' when the 'event_name' was the start of the current stage. This difference is then divided by the total time from 'Create Issue' to 'Change Status to Closed', which is calculated as the difference between the last 'end_time' for 'Change Status to Closed' and the first 'end_time' for 'Create Issue'. The result is then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing a series of calculations on the 'defaultview-217' table.
