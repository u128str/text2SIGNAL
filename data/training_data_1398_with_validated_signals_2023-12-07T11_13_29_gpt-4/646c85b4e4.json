{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the status of Warehouse Tasks (WTs) in the table 'defaultview-545'. It counts the number of occurrences of the event 'Create Warehouse Task' and 'Confirm Warehouse Task' in the 'event_name' column. If the count of 'Create Warehouse Task' is greater than zero and equal to the count of 'Confirm Warehouse Task', it labels the status as 'WTs completed'. If the count of 'Create Warehouse Task' is greater than the count of 'Confirm Warehouse Task', it labels the status as 'WTs partially completed'. If there are no 'Create Warehouse Task' events, it labels the status as 'W/o WTs'. If none of these conditions are met, it returns NULL. The query also counts the number of unique 'case_id' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. The result is presented in two columns: 'WTs Status' and 'No. of Cases'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the status of Warehouse Tasks (WTs) in the table 'defaultview-545'.
