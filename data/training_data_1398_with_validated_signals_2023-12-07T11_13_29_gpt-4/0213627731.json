The subquery filters out rows where 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date' and 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' are not null. It then calculates several metrics such as the count of distinct 'case_id' where the event name is 'Clear Invoice' for '# Cleared Invoices', the sum of 'Converted USD Amount' where the event name is 'Clear Invoice' for 'Cleared Amount', and the average of 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' minus 'Inv. Accounting Document Date' where the event name is 'Clear Invoice' for 'AVG Net Payment Terms'. The 'Late Payment Rate %' is calculated as the percentage of invoices cleared late. The 'Late Payment Rate % (rounded)' is the rounded average of 'Late Payment Rate %'. If the decimal part of the average is greater than or equal to 0.5, it rounds up, otherwise it rounds down. The 'AVG Payment Time' is the average time between the accounting document date and the clearing date. The 'AVG Paid Late Days' is the average number of days an invoice is paid late, if it is paid late.
