{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve and summarize data from the table named 'defaultview-225'. It calculates the total sum of the 'Inv.

The query also retrieves the 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Name' and labels it as 'Vendor Name'. The WHERE clause in the query filters the data based on three conditions. The first condition checks if the 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1' is less than 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1' or 0 if 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 1' is NULL. The second condition checks if 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2' is less than 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2' or 0 if 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master CD 2' is NULL. The third condition checks if 'Last Inv. Item Net Payment Terms Period' is less than 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD' or 0 if 'Last Inv. Item Vendor Master NDD' is NULL.
