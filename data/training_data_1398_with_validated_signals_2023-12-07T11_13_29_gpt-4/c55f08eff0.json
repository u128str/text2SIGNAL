{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is calculating the percentage of unique events, identified by 'UniqueEventId', that were created by either a 'System' or 'Service' user type and involved an 'Update' to a 'Sales' event. This is done by first counting the distinct 'UniqueEventId' where 'EventCreatedByUserType' is either 'System' or 'Service', the event name contains 'Sales', and the 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. This count is then divided by the total count of distinct 'UniqueEventId' where 'EventCreatedByUserType' is not null. The result is multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
