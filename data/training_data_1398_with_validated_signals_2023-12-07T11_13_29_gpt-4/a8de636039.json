This is done by first counting the number of 'case_id' where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Invoice' and does not match any of the listed events. This count is then divided by the total number of 'case_id' where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Invoice'. The result is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
