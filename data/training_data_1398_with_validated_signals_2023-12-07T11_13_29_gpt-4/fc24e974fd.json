{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the 'defaultview-225' table. It first creates a subquery named 'sub_query_Event_Cycle_Time' where it selects the 'Event_Name' column, the preceding 'Event_Name' in the sequence as 'Following event', and calculates the 'Event_Cycle_Time' by subtracting the preceding 'End_Time' from the current 'End_Time' for each 'Case_Id'. This subquery only includes rows where 'Event_Cycle_Time' is not null. Then, in the main query, it groups the data by 'Event_Name' and 'Following event', and calculates the total count of 'PO items', the average, minimum, and maximum 'Lead Time' for each group. The results are sorted in descending order by the count of 'PO items'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the 'defaultview-225' table.
