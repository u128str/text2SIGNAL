{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It starts by counting the distinct values in the 'Last Invoice Id' column, which is then labeled as 'Invoice Volume'. This count gives us the total number of unique invoices. Then, it selects the 'PO Item Supplier ID' column and labels it as 'Supplier'. This column represents the ID of the supplier for each purchase order item. The query then groups the results by the second selected column, which is 'Supplier'. This means that the output will be organized by unique supplier IDs. After that, the results are ordered in descending order based on the first selected column, which is 'Invoice Volume'. This means that the suppliers with the highest number of unique invoices will be at the top. Finally, the query limits the output to the top 10 results. This means that we will only see the 10 suppliers with the highest number of unique invoices.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
