{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to categorize and count accounts receivable based on their overdue status. The query is performed on the 'defaultview-197' table. The 'NetDueDate' column is used to calculate the overdue status. If the current date is equal to the 'NetDueDate', the account is categorized as 'Due'. If the current date is between 0 and 7 days past the 'NetDueDate', the account is categorized as '0-7 days' overdue. This pattern continues with categories for 8-14 days, 15-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and more than 90 days overdue. The 'ARUniqueKey' column is used to count the number of receivables in each category. The query only considers rows where 'NetDueDate' is not null, the event name is 'Create Accounts Receivable', the 'ClearingDate' is null, and the current date is greater than or equal to 'NetDueDate'. The results are ordered in ascending order by the overdue category.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to categorize and count accounts receivable based on their overdue status.
