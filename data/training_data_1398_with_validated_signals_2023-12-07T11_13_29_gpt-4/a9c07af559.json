{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract specific information from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the count of 'CASE_ID' and renames it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average time difference between the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' and the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create PO Item', and this average time difference is renamed as 'Avg Cycle Time PO Create to PO Release'. The query also selects the 'PO Type' column. The query only includes records where the time difference between the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' and the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create PO Item' is greater than 3 days. The results are grouped by the third selected column, which is 'PO Type'. The results are then ordered in descending order by the first selected column, which is 'No. of Cases'. Finally, the query limits the output to the top 20 records.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract specific information from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
