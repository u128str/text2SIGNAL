{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting two main pieces of information from the table named 'defaultview-545'. The first piece of information is the month of the first 'Create PO Item' event, which is being labeled as 'PO Creation Date'. This is achieved by truncating the 'end_time' to the month level for the first occurrence of the event named 'Create PO Item'. The second piece of information is the 'Change Rate', which is calculated as the percentage of cases where the event name contains either 'Update' or 'Change'. This is done by counting the number of case IDs where the event name contains 'Update' or 'Change' (ignoring case sensitivity), dividing it by the total number of case IDs, and then multiplying by 100. The results are then ordered in ascending order by the 'PO Creation Date', with any null values appearing first.
