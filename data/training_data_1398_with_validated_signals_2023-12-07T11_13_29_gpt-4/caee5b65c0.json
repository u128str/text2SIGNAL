{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the late delivery rate and average delay from a table named 'defaultview-183'. It first counts the number of cases where the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date' and divides this by the total number of cases, multiplying by 100 to get a percentage, which is labeled as 'Late delivery rate'. It then calculates the average delay by subtracting the 'Scheduled Finish Date' from the 'Actual Delivery Date' for cases where the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date'. This average delay is labeled as 'Avg delay'. The query also selects the 'Division' column from the table. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the 'Late delivery rate'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the late delivery rate and average delay from a table named 'defaultview-183'.
