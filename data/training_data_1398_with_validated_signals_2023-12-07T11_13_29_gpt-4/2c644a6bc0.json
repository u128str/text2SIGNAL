{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the number of cases by counting the 'CASE_ID' column and labels this as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time between 'Create PO Item' and 'Release PO' events by subtracting the last end time of 'Create PO Item' from the last end time of 'Release PO'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg Cycle Time PO Create to PO Release'. The query also retrieves the 'PO Item Material Group Text' column and labels it as 'Material Group'. The query only considers the cases where the cycle time between 'Create PO Item' and 'Release PO' is more than 3 days. The results are grouped by the 'Material Group' and ordered in descending order by the 'No. of Cases'. The query limits the output to the top 20 records.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
