{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing a calculation on the 'defaultview-222' table. It first counts the distinct values in the 'ARUniqueKey' column where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and 'AutomationFlag' is null. This count is then divided by the total count of distinct 'ARUniqueKey' values where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Accounts Receivable'.
