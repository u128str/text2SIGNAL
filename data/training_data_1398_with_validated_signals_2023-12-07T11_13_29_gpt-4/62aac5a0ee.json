It calculates a percentage by subtracting the ratio of the number of rows where the 'Last GR Creation Date' (truncated to the day) is later than the 'PO Requested Delivery Date' and the 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received', to the total number of rows where the 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received'. This ratio is then subtracted from 1 and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
