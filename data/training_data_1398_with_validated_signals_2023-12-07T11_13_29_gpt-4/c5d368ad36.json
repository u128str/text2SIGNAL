{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the count of 'CASE_ID' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time between the events 'Create Goods Receipt' and 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' by subtracting the last end time of 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' from the last end time of 'Create Goods Receipt'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. Additionally, the query retrieves the data from the column 'PO Item Material Group Text'. The results are grouped by the third column in the SELECT statement, which is 'PO Item Material Group Text'. The output is then ordered in descending order by the first column in the SELECT statement, which is 'No. of Cases'.
