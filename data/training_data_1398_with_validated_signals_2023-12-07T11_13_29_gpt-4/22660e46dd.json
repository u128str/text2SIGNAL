{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-431'. It performs several operations. First, it counts the number of 'case_id' entries, labeling the result as 'No of. PO Items'. Second, it calculates the average cycle time between the 'Create PR Item' event and the 'Pay Invoice' event. This is done by subtracting the time of the first 'Create PR Item' event from the time of the last 'Pay Invoice' event. The result is labeled as 'AVG Cycle Time'. Third, it retrieves the 'PO Item Line Type' entries and labels them as 'PO Item Type'. The query only considers rows where 'PO Item Line Type' is not null and the 'EVENT_NAME' follows the sequence 'Create PR Item' to 'Pay Invoice'. The results are ordered in descending order based on the count of 'case_id', with any null values placed at the end. The query limits the output to the top 10 results.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-431'.
