{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It calculates the count of the 'CASE_ID' column and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time between 'Create PR item' and 'Create PO Item' events by subtracting the first occurrence of 'END_TIME' for 'Create PR item' from the last occurrence of 'END_TIME' for 'Create PO Item'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time (PR to PO Creation)'. Additionally, the query retrieves the 'PO Item Supplier Id' and labels it as 'PO Supplier'.
