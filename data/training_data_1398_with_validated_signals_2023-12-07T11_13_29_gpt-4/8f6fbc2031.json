{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is calculating the percentage of cases in the table 'defaultview-57' where the first event name is 'Delete PO Item'. It does this by first counting the number of case_ids where the first event_name is 'Delete PO Item'. This is done using a subquery with a filter condition that checks if the event_name is 'Delete PO Item'. The result of this count is then divided by the total number of case_ids in the table 'defaultview-57'. The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage.
