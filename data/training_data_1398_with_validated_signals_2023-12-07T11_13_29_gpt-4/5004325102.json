{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of late deliveries from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates the difference between the 'Actual Delivery Date' and the 'Scheduled Finish Date' for each case. If the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date', the delivery is considered late. The query then categorizes these late deliveries into different time intervals: '0-1 days', '1-2 days', '2-3 days', '3-4 days', '4-5 days', '5-6 days', '6-7 days', '7-8 days', '8-9 days', '9-10 days', and '>10 days'. The result is a count of case IDs, labeled as 'Late deliveries', and the time difference category for each late delivery. The results are ordered in ascending order by the time difference category.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of late deliveries from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
