{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to perform operations on the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates the percentage and count of process orders where the event name does not match 'Technically completed'. The percentage is calculated by dividing the count of case IDs where the event name does not match 'Technically completed' by the total count of case IDs, and then multiplying by 100.

The count of case IDs where the event name does not match 'Technically completed' is also calculated separately and labeled as '# of Process Orders without TECO'.
