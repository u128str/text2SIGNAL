{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query is designed to evaluate the automation rate of three different processes: Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment, from the table 'defaultview-225'. It does this by counting distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' entries that meet certain criteria and then dividing this by the total count of distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' entries that meet a broader set of criteria. The criteria for the numerator is that the 'Event Created By User Type' must be either 'System' or 'Service' and the 'event_name' must contain certain keywords related to the process being evaluated. The criteria for the denominator is that the 'event_name' must contain the same keywords related to the process. The automation rate is then evaluated against thresholds of 70% and 30%. If the automation rate is above 70%, the query returns 'Automation rate is above 70%. No action needed.' If the automation rate is between 30% and 70%, the query returns 'Automation rate is between 30% and 70%. Potential for improvement.' If the automation rate is below 30%, the query returns 'Automation rate is below 30%. Improvement highly recommended.' This is done for each of the three processes and the results are returned as 'Purchase Order', 'Invoice', and 'Payment'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query is designed to evaluate the automation rate of three different processes: Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment, from the table 'defaultview-225'.
