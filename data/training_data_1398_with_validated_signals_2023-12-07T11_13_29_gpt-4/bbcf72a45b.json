{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-383'. It first checks the 'event_name' column for specific keywords such as 'Sales Doc', 'Quotation', 'Delivery Item', 'Invoice', and 'Dunning'. If any of these keywords are found, it categorizes them accordingly. If none of these keywords are found, it categorizes them as 'Other'. This categorization is then labeled as 'Change Category'. The query also retrieves the 'ChangeType' column and labels it as 'Change Type'. It also retrieves the 'event_name' column and labels it as 'Event Name'. The query then counts the unique entries in the 'UniqueEventId' column and labels this count as '# Occurrences'. It also counts the unique entries in the 'UniqueEventId' column where 'EventCreatedByUserType' is 'Dialog' and labels this count as '# Manual Changes'. It also calculates the percentage of unique entries in the 'UniqueEventId' column where 'EventCreatedByUserType' is either 'System', 'Service', or 'Batch Job' and labels this percentage as 'Automation Rate in %'. The query only retrieves rows where 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. The results are then ordered by the third column in descending order.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-383'.
