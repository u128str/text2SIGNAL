{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-431'. It performs several operations. First, it counts the number of 'case_id' entries, which is then labeled as 'No of. PO Items'. Second, it calculates the average cycle time between the 'Create PR Item' event and the 'Pay Invoice' event. This is done by subtracting the first occurrence of 'Create PR Item' from the last occurrence of 'Pay Invoice'. The result is labeled as 'AVG Cycle Time'. Third, it retrieves the 'Accounting Company Code' and labels it as 'Company Code Name'. The query only considers rows where 'PO Purchasing Group' is not null and where the 'EVENT_NAME' follows the sequence 'Create PR Item' to 'Pay Invoice'. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the first column, which is 'No of. PO Items'. Finally, the query limits the output to the top 10 rows.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-431'.
