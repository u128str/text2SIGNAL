{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average clearing time and the clearing date from a subquery. The subquery is derived from the 'defaultview-197' table.

This difference is calculated over each 'BillingDocument' partition, ordered by 'end_time', and is named as 'AVG_ClearingTime'. The main query then takes this subquery (named as 'temp'), filters it where 'event_name' equals 'Clear Accounts Receivable', and calculates the average of 'AVG_ClearingTime' (renamed as 'AVG Clearing Time') and truncates the 'wa' to the month (renamed as 'Clearing Date').
