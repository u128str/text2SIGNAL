It counts the distinct number of 'UniqueEventId' and labels this count as '# Changes per case'. It also selects the 'event_name' and labels it as 'SO Change', and the 'InvoiceCompanyCode' and labels it as 'Company Code Name'. The query only considers rows where the 'EventCreatedByUserType' is 'Dialog', the 'event_name' contains the phrase 'Sales Doc', and the 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. These conditions are grouped under a behavior named 'created_with_dialog'. The results are grouped by the second and third selected columns, which are 'SO Change' and 'Company Code Name'. The results are then ordered in descending order by the count of distinct 'UniqueEventId'.
