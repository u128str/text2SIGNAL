{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query is designed to evaluate the automation rate of three different processes: Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment, from the table 'defaultview-225'. It does this by counting distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' entries that are associated with specific event names and were created by either 'System' or 'Service' user types. For the Purchase Order process, it looks for event names that contain 'PO', 'Purchase Order', or 'Order Confirmation'. For the Invoice process, it looks for event names that contain 'Invoice' or 'Memo'. For the Payment process, it looks for event names that contain 'Payment Proposal' or 'Payment Posting'. The automation rate is calculated as the ratio of the count of distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' entries created by 'System' or 'Service' to the total count of distinct 'Inv. Accounting Document Number' entries for each process. Depending on the automation rate, the query returns a message indicating whether the automation rate is above 70% (no action needed), between 30% and 70% (potential for improvement), or below 30% (improvement highly recommended).", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query is designed to evaluate the automation rate of three different processes: Purchase Order, Invoice, and Payment, from the table 'defaultview-225'.
