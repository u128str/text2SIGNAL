{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is counting the number of 'event_name' from the table 'defaultview-291'. However, it is not just a simple count.

The 'iLIKE' function is used here which is a case-insensitive version of the LIKE function. So, it will match 'Update Delivery' irrespective of the case.
