{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates two metrics: the percentage of automation rate for material availability checks and the count of material availability checks. The percentage of automation rate is calculated by counting the number of events where the 'Event Created By User Type' is not 'Dialog' and dividing it by the total number of events, then multiplying by 100. The count of material availability checks is calculated by counting the number of events where the 'Event Created By User Type' is not 'Dialog' and the event name is 'Material availability checked'. The query also selects the 'Plant' column. The query only considers rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Check Material Availability'. The result is ordered in descending order by the first calculated metric and limited to the top 11 rows.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
