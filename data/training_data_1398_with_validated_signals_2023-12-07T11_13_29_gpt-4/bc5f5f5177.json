This is done by counting the number of case IDs where the event name matches a specific sequence of events. The sequence starts with 'Create Production Order', followed by 'Create Shop Floor Control', then any event starting with 'Start Step', followed by any event starting with 'Complete Step', and finally 'Post Goods Receipt'. The count of these specific cases is then divided by the total count of case IDs and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage, which is labeled as 'Conformance Rate%'.
