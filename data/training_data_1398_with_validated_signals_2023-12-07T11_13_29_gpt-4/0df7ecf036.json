{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the count of 'CASE_ID' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' from the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Goods Receipt'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. The query also retrieves the data from the column 'PO Item Plant City' and labels it as 'PO Plant City'. The results are grouped by the third column in the SELECT statement, which is 'PO Plant City'.
