{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to perform operations on the table named 'defaultview-545'. It starts by selecting and counting the distinct values in the 'Last Invoice Id' column, which is then labeled as 'No. of Invoices'. Next, it calculates the sum of all values in the 'Last Invoice Item Amount' column and labels this as 'Invoice Item Amount'. Additionally, it selects the values from the 'Last Invoice Submission Method' column. The query then groups the results by the third column selected, which is 'Last Invoice Submission Method'. Finally, it orders the results in descending order based on the first column in the selection, which is the count of distinct 'Last Invoice Id'.
