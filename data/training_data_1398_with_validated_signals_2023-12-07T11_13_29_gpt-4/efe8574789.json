{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates and returns the total number of cases, the average cycle time between the 'Create Goods Receipt' event and the 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' event, and the last Goods Receipt (GR) Plant. The 'No. of Cases' is calculated by counting the number of 'CASE_ID'. The 'Avg. Cycle Time' is calculated by finding the difference between the last 'END_TIME' of the 'Create Goods Receipt' event and the last 'END_TIME' of the 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' event, and then taking the average of these differences. The 'GR Plant' is simply the value of the 'Last GR Plant' column. The results are grouped by the third selected column, which is 'Last GR Plant'. The results are then ordered in descending order by the first selected column, which is 'No. of Cases'. The query limits the output to the top 50 records.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
