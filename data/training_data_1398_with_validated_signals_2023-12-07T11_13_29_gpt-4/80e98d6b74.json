{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting data from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It is creating a new column named 'CaseId' which is populated with the values from the 'case_id' column.

This is done by subtracting the first occurrence of the 'end_time' when the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to To Do' from the first occurrence of the 'end_time' when the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Backlog'. This calculated average is then assigned to a new column named 'Avg. Cycle Time for tickets in Backlog to To Do'. The query is only considering rows where the 'event_name' changes from 'Change Status to Backlog' to 'Change Status to To Do'. The result is then ordered in descending order by the second column, which is the calculated average cycle time.
