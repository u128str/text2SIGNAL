{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics from the 'defaultview-124' table. It first renames the 'PO Vendor Name' column to 'Vendor Name'. Then, it calculates the sum of the 'Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Document Curr.' column and renames it to 'Inv Amount'. It also counts the number of cases in the 'CASE_ID' column and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. The query then calculates the average time difference between the last 'Create PO Item' event and the first 'Create PR Item' event, and labels it as 'Confirmation time for PRs'. Similarly, it calculates the average time difference for several other pairs of events, including 'Create Goods Receipt' and 'Create PO Item', 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item', 'Create Goods Receipt' and 'Release PO', 'Create FI Invoice' and 'Create Goods Receipt', and 'Clear Invoice' and 'Create FI Invoice'. These time differences are respectively labeled as 'Processing time for POs', 'PO Creation to PO Release', 'PO Released to Goods Receipt', 'Goods Receipt to Create FI Invoice', and 'Create FI Invoice to Clear Invoice'. Finally, the query calculates the average total cycle time, which is the difference between the last and first 'END_TIME'. The results are grouped by the first column (which is 'Vendor Name' after renaming) and ordered in descending order by the third column (which is 'Inv Amount' after renaming).", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics from the 'defaultview-124' table.
