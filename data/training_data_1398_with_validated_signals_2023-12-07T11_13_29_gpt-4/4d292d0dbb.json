{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of tickets and determine the hour of the first event where the status was changed to 'In Review'.

It then selects the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Review' and extracts the hour from this timestamp, labeling it as 'Hour'.
