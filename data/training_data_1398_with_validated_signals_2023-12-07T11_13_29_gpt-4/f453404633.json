{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It counts the number of occurrences of the 'event_name' and labels this count as '# Created Process Orders'. It also calculates the 'Automation Rate' by counting the number of 'EVENT_NAME' that were not created by a 'Dialog' user type, dividing this by the total count of 'EVENT_NAME', and multiplying the result by 100. The query also selects the 'Division' column. The query only considers rows where the 'Planned Order Number' is NULL and the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Process Order'. The results are ordered in descending order based on the count of 'event_name'.
