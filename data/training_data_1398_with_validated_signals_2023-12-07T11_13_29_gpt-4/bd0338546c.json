{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It calculates the count of the 'CASE_ID' column and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time between the events 'Receive invoice' and 'Approve Invoice' by subtracting the first occurrence of 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Receive invoice' from the last occurrence of 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Approve Invoice'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time (Receive to Apprv Inv.)'. Additionally, the query retrieves the data from the column 'PO Business Unit'.
