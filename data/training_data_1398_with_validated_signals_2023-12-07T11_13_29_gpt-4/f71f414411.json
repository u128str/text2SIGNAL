{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It performs two main operations. Firstly, it selects the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create PO Item', truncates this date to the month and labels it as 'PO Creation Date'. Secondly, it calculates the 'Change Rate' by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where the 'EVENT_NAME' contains either 'Update' or 'Change' (case insensitive), divides this by the total count of 'CASE_ID' and multiplies the result by 100. The output is then ordered in ascending order by the 'PO Creation Date', with any null values appearing first. The query also fills in any missing time series data for each month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
