{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates and returns the total number of cases, the average cycle time between the 'Create FI Invoice' and 'Create Goods Receipt' events, and the last Goods Receipt (GR) storage location. The number of cases is calculated by counting the 'CASE_ID'. The average cycle time is calculated by subtracting the last end time of the 'Create Goods Receipt' event from the last end time of the 'Create FI Invoice' event. The last GR storage location is directly taken from the 'Last GR Storage Location' column. The results are grouped by the third column, which is 'Last GR Storage Location'.
