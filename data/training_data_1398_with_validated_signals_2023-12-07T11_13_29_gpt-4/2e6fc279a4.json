{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It starts by counting the number of cases, represented by the 'CASE_ID' column, and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. It then calculates the sum of the values in the 'Last FI Invoice Item Gross Amount Local Curr.' column and labels this sum as 'Invoice Amount (INR)'. The query also retrieves the values from the 'PO Type' column and labels them as 'PO Type'. The query only considers the rows where the 'Last FI Invoice Item Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last FI Invoice Item Clearing Date'. The results are then grouped by the third column specified in the SELECT statement, which is 'PO Type'. The results are ordered in descending order based on the count of 'CASE_ID'.
