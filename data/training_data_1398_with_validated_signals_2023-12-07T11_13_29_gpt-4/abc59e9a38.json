{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is performing operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'. It starts by selecting and counting the number of 'CASE_ID' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. Then, it calculates the average time difference between the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' and the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create PO Item'. This average time difference is labeled as 'Avg Cycle Time PO Create to PO Release'. Additionally, it selects the 'PO Item Plant' column and labels it as 'PO Plant'. The query only considers the records where the time difference between the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' and the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create PO Item' is greater than 3 days. The results are then grouped by the third selected column, which is 'PO Plant'.
