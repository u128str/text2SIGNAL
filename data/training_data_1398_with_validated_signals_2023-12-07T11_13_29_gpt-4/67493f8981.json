{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It specifically targets issues of type 'Bug' and events that follow the sequence of 'Create Issue' and then 'Change Status to In Progress'. The query also filters the data based on the 'IssueCreated' date, which should be between September 1, 2021, and December 31, 2099. Additionally, the first 'end_time' date after truncating to the day level should be between June 1, 2022, and June 30, 2099. The query then groups the data by the month of the first 'end_time' for 'Create Issue' events, which is labeled as 'Issue Creation Date'. It also calculates the average time difference between the first 'end_time' for 'Change Status to In Progress' events and the last 'end_time' for 'Create Issue' events, which is labeled as 'CT Start working on it'. The results are ordered in ascending order by 'Issue Creation Date' with any null values appearing first.
