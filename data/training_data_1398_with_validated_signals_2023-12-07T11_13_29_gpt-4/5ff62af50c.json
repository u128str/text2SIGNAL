{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the unique 'case_id' from the table named 'defaultview-383'. However, it doesn't count all the 'case_id'. It only counts those 'case_id' where the 'event_name' starts with 'Create Sales Order Item'. This is achieved by using the FILTER clause along with the BEHAVIOR function. The BEHAVIOR function is used to filter the rows based on the pattern of the 'event_name'. In this case, it filters out the rows where 'event_name' starts with 'Create Sales Order Item'. The MATCHES keyword is used to match the filtered rows with the 'created' alias. The DISTINCT keyword ensures that each 'case_id' is only counted once, even if it appears multiple times.
