{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of case IDs, which are referred to as 'Early releases', from the table named 'defaultview-183'. The count is based on the difference between the 'Scheduled Release Date' and the 'Actual Release Date'. If the 'Scheduled Release Date' is greater than the 'Actual Release Date', the case is considered for counting. The difference between these two dates is categorized into several ranges: 0-5 days, 5-10 days, 10-15 days, 15-20 days, 20-25 days, 25-30 days, 30-35 days, 35-40 days, 40-45 days, 45-50 days, and more than 50 days. Each range is labeled respectively from '0-5 days' to 'k) >50 days'. The result is then ordered in ascending order based on these categories.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of case IDs, which are referred to as 'Early releases', from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
