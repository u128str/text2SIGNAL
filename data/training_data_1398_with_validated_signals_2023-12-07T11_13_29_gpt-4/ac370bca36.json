{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It calculates and returns two main pieces of information. Firstly, it counts the total number of cases, which is determined by counting the number of 'CASE_ID'. This count is then labeled as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the first 'end_time' from the last 'end_time' for each case, and then taking the average of these differences. This average is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. Additionally, the query retrieves the 'PO Business Unit' for each case. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order based on the first column, which is the count of 'CASE_ID'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
