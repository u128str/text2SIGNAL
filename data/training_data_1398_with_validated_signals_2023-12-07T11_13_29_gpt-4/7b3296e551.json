{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates and returns three pieces of information. Firstly, it counts the number of cases, which is determined by counting the number of 'CASE_ID'. This count is then labeled as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the first 'END_TIME' from the last 'END_TIME' for each case, and then taking the average of these differences. This average is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. Lastly, it retrieves the 'PO Vendor Name' for each case and labels it as 'Vendor Name'. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the count of 'CASE_ID'. The query is limited to return only the top 50 results.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
