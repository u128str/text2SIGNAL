{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to select and summarize data from the table named 'defaultview-431'. It specifically targets the column 'PO Currency' and 'PO Item Total Amount'. The query first checks if the 'PO Currency' is not null. Then, it categorizes the 'PO Currency' into different currency names such as 'South African Rand', 'United Arab Emirates Dirham', 'Hong Kong Dollar', 'Russian Ruble', 'Danish Krone', 'Swedish Krona', 'Swiss Franc', 'Brazilian Real', 'GB Pound Sterling', 'Australian Dollar', 'Japanese Yen', 'Mozambican Metical', 'Canadian Dollar', 'Chilean Peso', 'Euro', 'Indian Rupee', 'Singapore Dollar', 'Nigerian Naira', 'Taiwan Dollar', and 'US Dollar'. If the 'PO Currency' does not match any of these, it is categorized as 'Unmapped Currenc(ies)'. This categorization is then assigned to a new column named 'Currency'. The query also calculates the sum of the 'PO Item Total Amount' and rounds it off. This rounded sum is then assigned to a new column named 'PO Item Total Amount'. Finally, the query sorts the results in descending order based on the second column, which is the rounded sum of the 'PO Item Total Amount'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to select and summarize data from the table named 'defaultview-431'.
