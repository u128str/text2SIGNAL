{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the count of 'CASE_ID' and labels it as 'No. of Cases'. It also calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Release PO' from the last 'END_TIME' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. The query also retrieves the data from the column 'PO Item Plant' and labels it as 'PO Plant'. The results are grouped by the third column in the SELECT statement, which is 'PO Plant'. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order by the first column in the SELECT statement, which is 'No. of Cases'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
