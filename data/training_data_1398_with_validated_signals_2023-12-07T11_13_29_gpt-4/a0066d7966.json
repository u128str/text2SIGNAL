{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It is specifically looking at the column 'PO Currency' and checking if it is not null. If the 'PO Currency' is not null, it checks the value of the 'PO Currency' and maps it to the full name of the currency. For example, if the 'PO Currency' is 'ZAR', it is mapped to 'South African Rand'. If the 'PO Currency' is 'AED', it is mapped to 'United Arab Emirates Dirham', and so on for various other currency codes. If the 'PO Currency' does not match any of the specified codes, it is labeled as 'Unmapped Currenc(ies)'. The query then calculates the sum of the 'PO Item Total Amount' and rounds it. The result is ordered by the second column in descending order, which is the rounded sum of the 'PO Item Total Amount'. The output of this query will be two columns, one named 'Currency' which contains the full name of the currency, and the other named 'PO Item Total Amount' which contains the rounded sum of the 'PO Item Total Amount' for each currency.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is selecting data from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
