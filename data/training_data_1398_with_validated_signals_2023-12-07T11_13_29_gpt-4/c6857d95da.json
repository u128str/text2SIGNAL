{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates two metrics: the total number of process orders released early and the percentage of process orders released early. A process order is considered 'released early' if the 'Actual Release Date' is earlier than the 'Scheduled Release Date'. The query counts the number of such cases and labels this count as '# Process Orders released early'. Then, it calculates the percentage of early released orders by dividing the number of early released orders by the total number of orders, and multiplies the result by 100. This percentage is labeled as '% Released Early'. The query also selects the 'Division' column from the table. The results are sorted in descending order by the number of early released orders, and only the top 10 records are returned.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
