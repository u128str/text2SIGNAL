{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing a calculation on the 'defaultview-57' table. It is calculating the sum of the product of 'PO Item Total Invoiced Net Amount in USD' and 'Last FI Invoice Item Cash Discount Percentage 1' (which is also multiplied by 0.01), and then subtracting the 'Last FI Invoice Cash Discount in USD' from this product. The result of this calculation is the total sum for all rows in the table. Note that there are two commented out lines in the query which are not being executed. The first one is an alternative FROM clause using the FLATTEN function on the 'defaultview-57' table, and the second one is a WHERE clause that would filter the data to only include rows where the 'event_name' matches 'Delete PO Item'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing a calculation on the 'defaultview-57' table.
