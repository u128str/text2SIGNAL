First, it selects the last 'END_TIME' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Post Invoice', and truncates this date to the month, labeling the result as 'Invoice Post Date'. Second, it calculates the percentage of events where 'Event Created By User Type' is either 'System' or 'Service' out of the total number of 'EVENT_NAME', and labels this as 'Percentage of automated events'. The query only considers rows where 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Vendor Creates Invoice'. The results are ordered in ascending order by the 'Invoice Post Date', with any null values appearing first.
