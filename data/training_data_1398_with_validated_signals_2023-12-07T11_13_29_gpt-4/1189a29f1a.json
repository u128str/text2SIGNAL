{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the 'On-time delivery rate' from the table named 'defaultview-290'. It first truncates the 'end_time' column to the month level. This is done by selecting the first 'end_time' value and truncating it to the month. This value is then labeled as 'Month'. Next, it counts the number of 'CASE_ID' where the count of 'EVENT_NAME' is greater than 0 and 'DeliveryGoodsMovementOnTime' is 'Yes'. This count is then divided by the total count of 'CASE_ID' where 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Outbound Delivery'. The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to get the 'On-time delivery rate'. The query then orders the result in ascending order by the 'Month' column, placing any null values first. Finally, it fills any missing time series data for 'Month' with null values.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the 'On-time delivery rate' from the table named 'defaultview-290'.
