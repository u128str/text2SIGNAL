{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it selects the first occurrence of the 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Closed' and truncates this date to the month. This value is then labeled as 'Month when Issue Closed'. Secondly, it calculates the average duration between the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Closed' and the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress'. This duration is then filtered to only include events where the 'event_name' transitions from 'Change Status to In Progress' to 'Change Status to Closed'. This calculated average duration is labeled as 'Duration'. The results are then grouped and ordered by the 'Month when Issue Closed'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-217'.
