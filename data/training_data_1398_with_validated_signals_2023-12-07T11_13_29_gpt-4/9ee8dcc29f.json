{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing a calculation on the 'defaultview-222' table. It is calculating the percentage of the total 'AmountInGlobalCurrency' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is like 'Clear Accounts Receivable' and the difference between 'ClearingDate' and 'NetDueDate' is more than one day, over the total 'AmountInGlobalCurrency' where the 'EVENT_NAME' is like 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. The SUM function is used to add up the 'AmountInGlobalCurrency' for the specified conditions. The FILTER function is used to apply the conditions on the 'EVENT_NAME' and the difference between 'ClearingDate' and 'NetDueDate'. The LIKE keyword is used to match the 'EVENT_NAME' with 'Clear Accounts Receivable'. The DURATION keyword is used to specify a duration of '1day'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing a calculation on the 'defaultview-222' table.
