{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the distinct 'UniqueEventId' from the table 'defaultview-383'.

According to this clause, an event is considered only if its 'event_name' contains the word 'Delivery' and its 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. The BEHAVIOR function is used to apply this condition. The result of this function is aliased as 'changed' and then used in the MATCHES clause to filter the events.
