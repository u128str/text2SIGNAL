{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It first checks if the columns 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and 'Last Invoice Due Date' are not null. Then, it calculates the sum of the 'Last Invoice Item Amount'. The query also categorizes the payment based on the difference between 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and 'Last Invoice Due Date'. If the payment was made on or before the due date, it is categorized as 'before or on Due Date'. If the payment was made within 7 days after the due date, it is categorized as '0-7 days after Due Date'. If the payment was made between 8 to 14 days after the due date, it is categorized as '8-14 days after Due Date'. If the payment was made between 15 to 30 days after the due date, it is categorized as '15-30 days after Due Date'. If the payment was made between 31 to 60 days after the due date, it is categorized as '31-60 days after Due Date'. If the payment was made between 61 to 90 days after the due date, it is categorized as '61-90 days after Due Date'.
