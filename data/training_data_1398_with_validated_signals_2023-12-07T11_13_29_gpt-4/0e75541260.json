{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing operations on the table named 'defaultview-225'. It calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first end time where the event name is 'Post Invoice' from the last end time where the event name is 'Clear Invoice'. The result of this calculation is labeled as 'Average Cycle Time'. The query also categorizes the data into 'PO Invoice' and 'Non-PO Invoice' based on whether the 'Last PO Id' is null or not. This categorization is labeled as 'PO Category'. The query only considers the rows where the 'Last Payment Clearing Date' is not null, the event name matches the sequence 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice', and the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is less than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date'. The results are grouped by the 'PO Category' and ordered in descending order by the 'Average Cycle Time'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing operations on the table named 'defaultview-225'.
