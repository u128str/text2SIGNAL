{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics from the 'defaultview-225' table. It first renames the 'event_name' column to 'Event Name'. Then, it counts the distinct number of 'case_id' and labels it as '# of Invoices'. It also counts the total number of 'event_name' and labels it as '# of Events'. The query then filters the 'Event Created By User Type' column to count the number of events created manually (i.e., by 'Dialog') and labels it as '# of Manual Events'. Similarly, it counts the number of events created automatically (i.e., by 'System' or 'Service') and labels it as '# of Automated Events'. The query also calculates the automation rate by dividing the number of automated events by the total number of events and multiplying the result by 100. This is labeled as 'Automation Rate in %'. The query only considers rows where 'Event Created By User Type' is not null. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order by the third column, which is '# of Events'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics from the 'defaultview-225' table.
