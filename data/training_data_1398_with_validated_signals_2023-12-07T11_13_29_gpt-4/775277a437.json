{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the percentage of billing documents that have been cancelled, along with the project type. It operates on the 'defaultview-197' table. The query first counts the distinct number of 'BillingDocument' where the event name is 'Cancel Billing Document', and divides it by the count of distinct 'BillingDocument' where the event name is 'Create Billing Document'. This ratio is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of billing documents cancelled. This value is then rounded to the nearest whole number using a CASE statement. If the decimal part of the percentage is greater than or equal to 0.5, it rounds up, otherwise it rounds down. The 'WBSE_ProjectType' column is also selected and renamed as 'Project Type'. The resulting data is then ordered in descending order based on the percentage of billing documents cancelled.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the percentage of billing documents that have been cancelled, along with the project type.
