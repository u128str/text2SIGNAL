{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to provide a summary of cases started, completed, and active on a monthly basis from the table 'defaultview-9'. The 'Month' column is derived from the 'end_time' column of the table, with the month of the first and last 'end_time' being selected. The 'Cases Started During Month' is a count of instances where the 'started' column equals 1, indicating a case was started. The 'Cases Completed During Month' is a count of instances where the 'started' column equals 0, indicating a case was completed. The 'Active Cases' is calculated by subtracting the count of cases completed in the previous month (obtained using the LAG function) from the count of cases started in the current month. If there are no cases started or completed, the count is replaced with 0. The results are then grouped by 'Month' and ordered in ascending order. The query also uses the FILL TIMESERIES function to ensure that there are rows for every month, even if there are no cases started or completed in a particular month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to provide a summary of cases started, completed, and active on a monthly basis from the table 'defaultview-9'.
