{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to count the total number of distinct cases and the number of cases with changes from the 'defaultview-124' table. It first selects the 'CASE_ID', 'EVENT_NAME', and 'PO Item Material Group Text' columns from the 'defaultview-124' table, but only where 'PO Item Material Group Text' is not null. It then renames 'PO Item Material Group Text' to 'PO Material Group'. In the next step, it checks if the 'EVENT_NAME' is one of the specified update events. If it is, it assigns a value of 1 to a new column 'CHANGES', otherwise it assigns null. Then, it counts the distinct 'CASE_ID' as 'Total No. of Cases' and counts the distinct 'CASE_ID' where 'CHANGES' equals 1 as 'Cases with Changes'. It also selects the 'PO Material Group' column. The result is ordered in descending order by the first column, which is 'Total No. of Cases', and only the top 20 rows are returned.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to count the total number of distinct cases and the number of cases with changes from the 'defaultview-124' table.
