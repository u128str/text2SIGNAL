{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is counting the distinct case IDs from the table named 'defaultview-225'. However, it is not counting all the case IDs. It is only counting those case IDs where the 'Change Type' column has a value that is similar to 'Update'. The similarity is case-insensitive, meaning it doesn't matter if the 'Update' is in lower case, upper case, or a mix of both. The BOOL_OR function is used to return true if any of the 'Change Type' values are similar to 'Update'. If none of the 'Change Type' values are similar to 'Update', it will return false. The FILTER clause is used to apply this condition to the COUNT function. So, in summary, the query is counting the number of unique case IDs where the 'Change Type' is similar to 'Update'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is counting the distinct case IDs from the table named 'defaultview-225'.
