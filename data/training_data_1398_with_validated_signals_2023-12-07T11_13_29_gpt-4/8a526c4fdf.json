{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates two things. First, it counts the total number of process orders, which is represented by the count of 'CASE_ID'. This count is then labeled as 'Process Orders'. Second, it calculates the percentage of process orders that have an 'EVENT_NAME' matching 'Material Shortage'. This is done by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Material shortage', dividing it by the total count of 'CASE_ID', and then multiplying by 100. This result is labeled as '% Material Shortage'. The query also retrieves the 'Division' column from the table. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order based on the first column, which is the count of 'Process Orders'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
