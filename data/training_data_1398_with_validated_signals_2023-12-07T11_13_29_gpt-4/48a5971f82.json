{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It first selects the first occurrence of the 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress' and truncates this date to the month. This is then labeled as 'Month'. The query then calculates the average time difference between the first occurrence of 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to Ready For Review' and the first occurrence of 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress'. This average time difference is labeled as '# Cases'. The query only considers rows where the 'event_name' transitions from 'Change Status to In Progress' to 'Change Status to Ready For Review'. The results are then grouped by 'Month' and ordered by 'Month'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-217'.
