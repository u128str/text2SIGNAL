{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is selecting several columns from a subquery on the 'defaultview-545' table. The columns selected are 'Vendor Number', 'Company Code Name', 'No. of Invoices paid late', 'Invoice Amount paid late', 'Posted as Overdue', 'Short Payment Terms', and 'High Rework Rate'. The 'Vendor Number' and 'Company Code Name' are directly mapped from 'PO Item Supplier ID' and 'Accounting Company Code' respectively. The 'Invoice Amount paid late' is the sum of 'Last Invoice Item Amount'. The 'No. of Invoices paid late' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id'. The 'Short Payment Terms' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and the difference between 'Last Invoice Due Date' and 'Last Invoice Accounting Date' is less than 7 days. The 'Posted as Overdue' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is null and the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the current date. The 'High Rework Rate' is the count of 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' and there is at least one event with more than one occurrence that is not 'Receive PO Item'.
