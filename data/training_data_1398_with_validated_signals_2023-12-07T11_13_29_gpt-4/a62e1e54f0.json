{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to perform operations on the table named 'defaultview-183'. It first selects and counts the number of occurrences of the 'EVENT_NAME' column, but only for those rows where the 'Event Created By User Type' is not 'Dialog'. This count is then divided by the total count of 'EVENT_NAME' and multiplied by 100 to get a percentage, which is labeled as '% Automation Create Process Order'. Additionally, the total count of 'EVENT_NAME' is also selected and labeled as '# Create Process Order'. The 'Division' column is also selected. The query only considers those rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' is 'Create Process Order'.
