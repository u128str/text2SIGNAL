{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average approval time for timesheet records in a specific company. It operates on the 'defaultview-197' table. Firstly, it calculates the time difference between the 'end_time' of each record and the 'end_time' of the first record where 'event_name' equals 'Create Timesheet Record'. This calculation is done for each 'TimesheetRecord'. The result is stored in a new column named 'AVG_ApprovalTime'. Then, it filters out the records where 'event_name' is either 'Approve Timesheet Record' or 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record'. Finally, it calculates the average of 'AVG_ApprovalTime' and groups the results by 'Project_CompanyCode', which is renamed to 'Company Code'. The results are ordered in descending order based on the average approval time.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average approval time for timesheet records in a specific company.
