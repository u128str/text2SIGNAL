{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the cycle time of goods receipt to invoice receipt from the 'defaultview-225' table. It categorizes the cycle time into seven different ranges: '0 - 5 Days', '5 - 10 Days', '11 - 20 Days', '21 - 30 Days', '31 - 40 Days', 'More than 40 Days', and 'No Goods Receipt'. For each of these categories, it calculates the average total cycle time, the number of invoices, the total invoice amount in USD, and the late payment rate in percentage. The late payment rate is calculated as the number of invoices where the last invoice item due date is earlier than the last invoice item clearing date, divided by the total number of invoices where the last invoice item clearing date is not null, multiplied by 100. The query only considers cases where the event 'Clear Invoice' has occurred. The results are then grouped by the cycle time range and sequence number, and ordered by the sequence number.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the cycle time of goods receipt to invoice receipt from the 'defaultview-225' table.
