{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is calculating the average approval time for timesheet records. It does this by first creating a subquery named 'ApprovalTimeCalculation' from the table 'defaultview-197'. In this subquery, it selects the columns 'case_id', 'TimesheetRecord', 'event_name', and calculates the difference between the 'end_time' of each record and the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Timesheet Record'. This difference is named as 'AVG_ApprovalTime'. The calculation is done separately for each 'TimesheetRecord' as specified by the 'PARTITION BY TimesheetRecord' clause. Then, from this subquery, it selects the average of 'AVG_ApprovalTime' where the 'event_name' is either 'Approve Timesheet Record' or 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record'.
