{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to analyze event data from the 'defaultview-225' table. It first selects the 'Event_Name', the preceding 'Event_Name' as 'Following event', the difference in 'End_Time' between the current and preceding event as 'Event_Cycle_Time', and the 'Event Created By User Type'. This is done within a subquery. The main query then filters out rows where 'Event Created By User Type' is null, the 'event_name' or 'Following event' contains 'Due Date' or 'Vendor', and where 'Event_name' is not the same as 'Following event'. The main query then groups the data by 'Event_Name' and 'Following event'. For each group, it calculates the count of 'Event_Name' as 'Occurence', the percentage of events created by 'System' or 'Service' as 'Automation Rate in %', and the average, minimum, and maximum 'Event_Cycle_Time' as 'AVG Lead Time', 'MIN Lead Time', and 'MAX Lead Time' respectively.
