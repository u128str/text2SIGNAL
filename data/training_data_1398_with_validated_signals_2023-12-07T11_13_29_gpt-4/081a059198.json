{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is performing operations on the table named 'defaultview-183'. It first checks for rows where the 'Actual Finish Date', 'Scheduled Finish Date', 'Actual Start Date', and 'Scheduled Start Date' are not null. Then, it calculates the 'Late delivery rate' by counting the number of cases where the 'Actual Delivery Date' is later than the 'Scheduled Finish Date' and dividing it by the total number of cases, multiplied by 100. The result is selected as a percentage. Additionally, it determines the 'release' status by comparing the 'Actual Release Date' and 'Scheduled Release Date'.
