{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing several operations on the table named 'defaultview-217'. It is calculating the average time difference between different stages of an event. The stages are 'Create Issue', 'Change Status to In Progress', 'Change Status to Ready for Review', 'Change Status to In Review', and 'Change Status to Closed'. For each stage transition, it finds the last 'end_time' of the initial stage and the first 'end_time' of the next stage, then calculates the difference. This is done for the transitions from 'Create Issue' to 'In Progress', 'In Progress' to 'Ready for Review', 'Ready for Review' to 'In Review', and 'In Review' to 'Closed'. The average of these time differences is then calculated for each transition. The results are returned as 'Create => In Progress', 'In Progress => Ready for Review', 'Ready for Review => In Review', and 'In Review => Closed'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing several operations on the table named 'defaultview-217'.
