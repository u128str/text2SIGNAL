{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics related to invoices from a table named 'defaultview-529'. The query first selects distinct cases from the table, calculating the 'Dunning Block Rate', 'Total Cycle Time', and 'Dunning Block Duration' for each case. It only includes cases where the event 'Clear Invoice' has occurred. Then, for each unique 'Inv. Company Code Text', it calculates the total 'Invoice Amount in $', the number of invoices, the average 'Dunning Block Rate', the average number of days from posting to the net due date, the percentage of invoices posted automatically, the 'Rework Rate', the 'Change Rate', the 'Late Payment Rate', the average 'Dunning Block Duration in Days', and the average 'Total Cycle Time'. The 'Rework Rate' is calculated as the percentage of cases where an event other than 'Create Goods Receipt' occurs more than once. The 'Change Rate' is calculated as the percentage of cases where the event name includes the word 'change'. The 'Late Payment Rate' is calculated as the percentage of cases where the 'Last Inv. Item Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Inv. Item Clearing Date'. The results are then ordered by the 'Invoice Amount in $' in descending order.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract and calculate various metrics related to invoices from a table named 'defaultview-529'.
