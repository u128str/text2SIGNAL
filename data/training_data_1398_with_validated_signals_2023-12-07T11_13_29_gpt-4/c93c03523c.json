{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the 'defaultview-124' table. It first creates a subquery (SUB1) that selects the 'CASE_ID', 'EVENT_NAME', and 'Last FI Invoice Item Terms of Payment Key' (renamed as 'Invoice Payment Term') columns. Then, it creates another subquery (SUB2) that selects the 'CASE_ID', checks if the 'EVENT_NAME' is one of the specified update events and if so, assigns a value of 1 to a new column 'CHANGES', and selects the 'Invoice Payment Term'. The main query then counts the distinct 'CASE_ID' as 'Total No. of Cases', counts the distinct 'CASE_ID' where 'CHANGES' equals 1 as 'Cases with Changes', and selects 'Invoice Payment Term'. The results are ordered in descending order by the first column (which is 'Total No. of Cases') and limited to the top 20 records.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the 'defaultview-124' table.
