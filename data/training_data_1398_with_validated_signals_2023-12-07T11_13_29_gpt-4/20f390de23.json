It also calculates the average cycle time between the events 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' by subtracting the last end time of 'Create PO Item' from the last end time of 'Release PO' and labels it as 'Avg Cycle Time PO Create to PO Release'. The query also retrieves the 'PO Vendor Name' and renames it as 'Vendor Name'. The query only includes records where the difference between the last end time of 'Release PO' and 'Create PO Item' is greater than 3 days. The results are grouped by the third column, which is 'Vendor Name'. The results are ordered in descending order by the first column, which is 'No. of Cases'.
