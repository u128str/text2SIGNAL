The ratio is calculated by dividing the count of 'case_id' where a subquery returns true by the total count of 'case_id'. The subquery checks if there is any 'event_name' that occurs more than once by using the 'BOOL_OR' function on the 'occurrence' column, which is the count of occurrences of 'event_name'. If there is at least one 'event_name' that occurs more than once, the subquery will return true.
