It calculates and returns the total number of cases, the average cycle time from receiving to approving an invoice, and the 'Bill to Location Id'. Specifically, the total number of cases is calculated by counting the 'CASE_ID'. The average cycle time is calculated by subtracting the time of the first event named 'Receive invoice' from the time of the last event named 'Approve Invoice'.
