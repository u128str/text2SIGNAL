Firstly, it counts the number of cases by counting the 'CASE_ID' column and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the first 'end_time' from the last 'end_time' for each case, and then taking the average of these differences. This average is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. Additionally, the query retrieves the data from the 'PO Item Line Type' column. The results are then sorted in descending order based on the first column, which is the count of cases.
