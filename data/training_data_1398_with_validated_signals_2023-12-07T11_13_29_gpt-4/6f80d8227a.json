{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'. Firstly, it counts the number of cases, which is represented by the column 'CASE_ID', and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the last end time where the event name is 'Create Goods Receipt' from the last end time where the event name is 'Create FI Invoice'. The result of this calculation is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. Additionally, the query retrieves the data from the column named 'PO Type'. Finally, the query groups the results by the third column in the SELECT statement, which is 'PO Type', and orders the results in descending order based on the first column in the SELECT statement, which is 'No. of Cases'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'.
