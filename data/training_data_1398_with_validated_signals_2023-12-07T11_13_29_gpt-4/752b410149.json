{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-183'. It calculates two things. Firstly, it counts the total number of process orders, which is represented by the count of 'CASE_ID'. Secondly, it calculates the percentage of process orders that have an event name matching 'Material Shortage'. This is done by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Material shortage', dividing it by the total count of 'CASE_ID', and then multiplying by 100. The query also selects the 'Plant' column. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the first calculated column, which is the total number of process orders. Finally, the query limits the output to the top 10 results.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-183'.
