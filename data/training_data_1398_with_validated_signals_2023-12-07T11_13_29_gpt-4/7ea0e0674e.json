{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is counting the distinct 'Last Invoice Id' from a subquery. The subquery is selecting 'Last Invoice Id', 'PO Item Supplier ID', and 'Last Invoice Date' from the table 'defaultview-545'. It is also creating a new column 'DuplicateCount' which counts the number of 'Last Invoice Id'. The grouping is done based on 'Last Invoice Id', 'PO Item Supplier ID', and 'Last Invoice Date'. The main query then filters out the results from the subquery where 'DuplicateCount' is more than 1. In other words, it is counting the distinct 'Last Invoice Id' where there are duplicates based on 'Last Invoice Id', 'PO Item Supplier ID', and 'Last Invoice Date'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is counting the distinct 'Last Invoice Id' from a subquery.
