{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average approval time for timesheet records. It operates on the 'defaultview-197' table. Initially, it calculates the difference between the end time of each event and the first end time of the 'Create Timesheet Record' event for each 'TimesheetRecord'. This difference is stored in a new column named 'AVG_ApprovalTime'. This operation is performed within a subquery, which also selects the 'case_id', 'ActivityType', 'TimesheetRecord', and 'event_name' columns. The subquery is then used as a table named 'ApprovalTimeCalculation'. From this table, the query selects rows where the 'event_name' is either 'Approve Timesheet Record' or 'Auto-Approve Timesheet Record'. Finally, it calculates the average of the 'AVG_ApprovalTime' column and renames it to 'AVG Approval Time'. It also selects the 'ActivityType' column and renames it to 'Activity Type'. The result is ordered by the 'AVG Approval Time' in descending order.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average approval time for timesheet records.
