{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it truncates the date to the month of the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create PO Item'. This value is then labeled as 'PO Creation Date'. Secondly, it calculates the 'Late Payment Rate'. This is done by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date', dividing it by the count of 'CASE_ID' where the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is not null, and then multiplying the result by 100. The query then orders the results in ascending order by the first column, placing null values first. Finally, it fills the time series for each month with null values where no data is available.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
