{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the percentage of billing documents that were rejected, along with the project type. It does this by first creating a subquery that counts the distinct number of billing documents where the event name is like 'Reject Billing Request' and divides it by the count of distinct billing documents where the event name is 'Create Billing Document'. This result is then multiplied by 100 to get the percentage of billing documents rejected. This percentage is then rounded to the nearest whole number using a CASE statement. If the decimal part of the percentage is greater than or equal to 0.5, it rounds up, otherwise it rounds down. The result of this calculation and the project type, which is represented by the column 'WBSE_ProjectType', are then selected from the subquery. The data is taken from the table 'defaultview-197'. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order by the percentage of billing documents rejected.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate and display the percentage of billing documents that were rejected, along with the project type.
