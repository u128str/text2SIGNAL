{"signal_description": "The query is selecting data from the table named 'defaultview-529'. It is renaming and selecting the columns 'Last Inv. Item Customer Number' as 'Customer Number', 'Inv. Company Code Text' as 'Company Code Name', 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 1', and 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Days 2'. It is also counting the number of case IDs and renaming it as 'No. Invoices'. The query is summing up the 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' and renaming it as 'Invoice Amount in $'. It is also calculating the maximum cash discount eligible by multiplying the 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' with 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage1' and dividing by 100. The gained cash discount is calculated by summing up the 'Inv. Converted USD Cash Discount Amount'. The lost cash discount is calculated by subtracting the 'Inv. Converted USD Cash Discount Amount' from the product of 'Inv. Converted USD Amount' and 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage1' divided by 100. The cash discount ratio is calculated by multiplying the result of the 'Max Cash Discount Eligible' calculation by 100. The query is filtering the data where 'Inv. Converted USD Amount Eligible for Cash Discount' is not equal to 0, either 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage1' or 'Last Inv. Item Cash Discount Percentage2' is not equal to 0, and 'Last Inv.
