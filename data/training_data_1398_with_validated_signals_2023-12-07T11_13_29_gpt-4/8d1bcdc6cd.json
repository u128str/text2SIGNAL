Firstly, it truncates the date to the month of the last 'Create PR Item' event, which is then labeled as 'PR Creation Date'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the time of the first 'Create PR Item' event from the time of the last 'Pay Invoice' event, and this result is labeled as 'AVG Cycle Time'. Thirdly, it counts the number of case_id, which is then labeled as 'No of. PO Items'. The query only considers rows where the EVENT_NAME column matches a sequence of 'Create PR Item' followed by 'Pay Invoice'. The results are ordered in ascending order by the first column, with any null values appearing first.
