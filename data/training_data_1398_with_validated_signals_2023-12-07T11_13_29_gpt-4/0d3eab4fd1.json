{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'. Firstly, it counts the number of cases by counting the 'CASE_ID' column and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time. This is done by subtracting the last end time where the event name is 'Receive Advanced Shipment Notice (ASN)' from the last end time where the event name is 'Create Goods Receipt'. The result of this calculation is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle Time'. The query also selects the 'PO Type' column from the table. The results are then grouped by the third selected column, which is 'PO Type'. Finally, the results are ordered in descending order by the first selected column, which is 'No. of Cases'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to perform several operations on the table named 'defaultview-124'.
