{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it selects the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Post Invoice' and truncates this date to the month. This value is then labeled as 'Invoice Post Date'. Secondly, it calculates the 'Automation rate'. To do this, it counts the number of 'EVENT_NAME' where 'Event Created By User Type' is not 'Diague', divides this by the total count of 'EVENT_NAME', and multiplies the result by 100. The query then filters the data from the table where 'event_name' matches a sequence of 'Post Invoice' followed by 'Clear Invoice'. The final result is ordered by the 'Invoice Post Date' in ascending order, with any null values appearing first. The data is filled in a time series format by month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'.
