{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-383'. It calculates the count of unique 'case_id' values and labels this as '# of SDs'. It also calculates the 'Change rate' by counting the distinct 'case_id' values where the 'EventCreatedByUserType' is 'Dialog' and 'ChangeType' is 'Update'. This count is then divided by the total count of distinct 'case_id' values and multiplied by 100 to get the percentage. Additionally, it retrieves the 'SalesDocCustomerCountry' values and labels it as 'SD Customer Country'.
