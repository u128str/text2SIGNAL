{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it truncates the date to the month of the first occurrence of the event named 'Post Invoice' and labels this column as 'Month'. Secondly, it counts the number of cases (CASE_ID) and labels this column as 'No. of Cases'. Thirdly, it calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the first occurrence of the event 'Post Invoice' from the last occurrence of the event 'Clear Invoice' and labels this column as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The results are then ordered in ascending order with any null values appearing first. Finally, the query fills in any missing time series data for 'Month'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-225'.
