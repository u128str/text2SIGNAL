{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates and returns the total number of cases, the average cycle time between the 'Release PO' and 'Release PR Item' events, and the type of PO. The total number of cases is calculated by counting the number of CASE_IDs. The average cycle time is calculated by subtracting the last end time of the 'Release PR Item' event from the last end time of the 'Release PO' event, and then taking the average of these values. The type of PO is directly retrieved from the 'PO Type' column. The results are grouped by the third selected column, which is 'PO Type'.
