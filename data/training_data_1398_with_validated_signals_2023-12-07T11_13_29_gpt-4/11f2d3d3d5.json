{"signal_description": "This SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the cycle time of goods receipt to invoice receipt from the table 'defaultview-133'. It first creates a subquery (SUB1) that selects distinct cycle times, total cycle times, case IDs, invoice amounts in USD, last invoice item due dates, and last invoice item clearing dates. The cycle time is calculated as the difference between the last end time of the 'Create FI Invoice' event and the last end time of the 'Create Goods Receipt' event. The total cycle time is calculated as the difference between the last and first end times. This subquery only includes cases where the last end time of the 'Clear Invoice' event is not null. The main query then groups these results by the cycle time and sequence number, and orders them by the sequence number. It calculates the average total cycle time, the number of invoices, the total invoice amount in USD, and the late payment rate in percent. The late payment rate is calculated as the number of cases where the last invoice item due date is earlier than the last invoice item clearing date divided by the number of cases where the last invoice item clearing date is not null, multiplied by 100. The cycle time is also categorized into ranges such as '0 - 5 Days', '5 - 10 Days', '11 - 20 Days', '21 - 30 Days', '31 - 40 Days', 'More than 40 Days', and 'No Goods Receipt', and these categories are assigned sequence numbers from 1 to 7 respectively.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"This SIGNAL query is designed to analyze the cycle time of goods receipt to invoice receipt from the table 'defaultview-133'.
