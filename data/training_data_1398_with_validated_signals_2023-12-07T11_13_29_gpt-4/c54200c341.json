{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-217'. It is specifically looking for records where the 'IssueType' is 'Bug' and the 'event_name' follows a sequence from 'Create Issue' to 'Change Status to In Progress'. The query also filters the data based on the 'IssueCreated' date, which should be between September 1, 2021, and December 31, 2099. Additionally, the first 'end_time' date, when truncated to the day, should be between June 1, 2022, and June 30, 2099. The query then performs three main operations. First, it counts the number of 'Case_id', which is returned as 'Number of bug tickets'. Second, it finds the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Issue', truncates this to the month, and returns it as 'Issue Creation Date'. Lastly, it calculates the average time difference between the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Change Status to In Progress' and the last 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Create Issue'. This average time difference is returned as 'CT Start working on it'. The results are then ordered by the 'Issue Creation Date' in ascending order, with any null values appearing first.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-217'.
