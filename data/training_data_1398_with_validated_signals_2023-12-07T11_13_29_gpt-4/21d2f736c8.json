{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is performing an operation on the table named 'defaultview-217'. It is calculating the percentage of case IDs where the event 'Change Status to In Progress' occurs more than once, out of the total number of case IDs where the event 'Change Status to In Progress' occurs at least once. The calculation is done in the following steps: First, it counts the number of case IDs where the event 'Change Status to In Progress' occurs more than once. This is done by filtering the 'event_name' column for the value 'Change Status to In Progress' and counting the 'case_id'. Then, it counts the total number of case IDs where the event 'Change Status to In Progress' occurs at least once. This is done similarly by filtering the 'event_name' column for the value 'Change Status to In Progress' and counting the 'case_id'. Finally, it divides the first count by the second count and multiplies the result by 100 to get the percentage.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is performing an operation on the table named 'defaultview-217'.
