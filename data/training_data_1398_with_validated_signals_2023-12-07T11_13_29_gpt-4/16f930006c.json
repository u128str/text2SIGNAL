{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It specifically targets rows where the 'PO Item Supplier Id' is not null. The query then performs several operations. Firstly, it counts the number of 'CASE_ID' and labels this count as 'No. of PO Items'. Secondly, it calculates the 'Late Delivery Rate'. This is done by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where the 'Last GR Creation Date' (when truncated to the day) is later than the 'PO Requested Delivery Date' and the 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received'. This count is then divided by the total count of 'CASE_ID' where the 'PO Delivery Status' is 'Received', and the result is multiplied by 100. The query also retrieves the 'PO Item Supplier Id'. The final output is ordered in descending order based on the first column (which is 'No. of PO Items') and is limited to the top 10 results.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
