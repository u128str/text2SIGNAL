{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is performing an operation on the table named 'defaultview-545'. Firstly, it is selecting the columns 'Last Invoice Id', 'PO Item Supplier ID', and 'Last Invoice Date'. Then, it is grouping the data by these three columns and counting the number of unique 'Last Invoice Id' for each group, which is named as 'DuplicateCount'. This operation results in a new table, which is referred to as 'a'. In the next step, from this new table 'a', the query is counting the distinct 'Last Invoice Id' where the 'DuplicateCount' is more than 1. In simpler terms, this query is used to find the count of unique 'Last Invoice Id' that have more than one occurrence in the table 'defaultview-545' when grouped by 'Last Invoice Id', 'PO Item Supplier ID', and 'Last Invoice Date'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is performing an operation on the table named 'defaultview-545'.
