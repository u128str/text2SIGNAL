{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the 'defaultview-225' table. It first checks the 'event_name' column for specific keywords related to purchase orders, invoices, and payments. If a match is found, it groups these events into 'PO events', 'Invoice events', and 'Payment Events' respectively. If no match is found, it retains the original 'event_name'. It then counts the distinct 'case_id' values, which is represented as '# of Invoices'. It also counts the total number of 'event_name' entries, represented as '# of Events'. The query further counts the number of 'event_name' entries where 'Event Created By User Type' is 'Dialog', represented as '# of Manual Events'. It also calculates the automation rate by counting the number of 'event_name' entries where 'Event Created By User Type' is either 'System' or 'Service', dividing it by the total number of 'event_name' entries, and multiplying by 100. This is represented as 'Automation Rate in %'. The query only considers rows where 'Event Created By User Type' is not null. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the third column, which is '# of Events'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to analyze data from the 'defaultview-225' table.
