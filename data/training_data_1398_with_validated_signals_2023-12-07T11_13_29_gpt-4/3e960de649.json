It first selects the earliest 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Post Invoice' and truncates this date to the month, labeling it as 'Invoice Post Date'. It then calculates the average cycle time by subtracting the earliest 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Clear Invoice' from the latest 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is 'Post Invoice'. This average cycle time is labeled as 'Average cycle time'. The query only considers rows where the 'event_name' transitions from 'Post Invoice' to 'Clear Invoice'.
