The RCA metrics include the number of invoices posted as overdue, the number of invoices with short payment terms, the high rework rate, the number of dunning block releases, the low automation of invoice postings, the number of credit memo documents created after invoice creation, and the number of manual changes. The query uses a variety of conditions to filter the data for these metrics, such as comparing the due date and clearing date of the invoice, checking if certain events occurred within a specific time frame, and checking the type of user who created the event.
