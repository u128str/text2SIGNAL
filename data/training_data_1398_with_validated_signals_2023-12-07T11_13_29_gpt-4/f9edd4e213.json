{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it selects the first 'end_time' where the 'event_name' is like 'Material Movement%' and truncates this date to the month, which is then labeled as 'Material Movement Creation Date'. Secondly, it calculates the rate of 'Material Movement Free' events by counting the number of 'CASE_ID' where 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Material Movement Free', dividing this by the total count of 'CASE_ID', and multiplying the result by 100. This value is labeled as 'Material Movement Free Rate'. Finally, the query orders the results in ascending order by the first column, handling null values first, and fills the time series by month.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-545'.
