{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract information from the table named 'defaultview-225'. It first truncates the date to the month of the first 'Post Invoice' event, which is then labeled as 'Month'. It then counts the number of case IDs, which is labeled as 'No. of Invoices'. The query also calculates the average cycle time, which is the difference between the last 'Clear Invoice' event and the first 'Post Invoice' event, and this is labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The query only considers rows where the event name transitions from 'Post Invoice' to 'Clear Invoice'. The results are then ordered in ascending order by the 'Month' column.
