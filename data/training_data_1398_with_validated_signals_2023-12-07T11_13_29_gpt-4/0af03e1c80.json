{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-431'. It performs several operations. Firstly, it counts the number of 'case_id' entries, which is then labeled as 'No of. PO Items'. Secondly, it calculates the average cycle time between the 'Create PR Item' event and the 'Pay Invoice' event. This is done by subtracting the time of the first 'Create PR Item' event from the time of the last 'Pay Invoice' event. The result is labeled as 'AVG Cycle Time'. Additionally, the query retrieves the 'PO Item Supplier ID'. The query only considers rows where the 'Commodity Id' is not null and where the 'EVENT_NAME' follows a specific sequence: from 'Create PR Item' to 'Pay Invoice'. The results are then ordered in descending order based on the 'AVG Cycle Time'. Finally, the query limits the output to the top 10 results.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to retrieve information from the table named 'defaultview-431'.
