{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average cycle time between the 'Create PR Item' event and the 'Pay Invoice' event from the table named 'defaultview-431'. It does this by first selecting the last end time for the 'Pay Invoice' event and subtracting from it the first end time for the 'Create PR Item' event. The result of this calculation is then averaged and labeled as 'Average Cycle Time'. The query also selects the 'PO Item Category' column. The query only considers rows where the 'event_name' column matches the sequence of 'Create PR Item' followed by 'Pay Invoice'. The results are then grouped by the second selected column, which is 'PO Item Category', and ordered in descending order by the first selected column, which is 'Average Cycle Time'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to calculate the average cycle time between the 'Create PR Item' event and the 'Pay Invoice' event from the table named 'defaultview-431'.
