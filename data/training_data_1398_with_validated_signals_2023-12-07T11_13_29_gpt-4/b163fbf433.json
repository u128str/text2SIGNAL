{"signal_description": "The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of process orders and group them by the material type text. Specifically, it operates on the table named 'defaultview-183'. It first selects the 'CASE_ID' column and counts the number of unique entries in this column, labeling this count as '# Process Orders'. Then, it selects the 'Material Type Text' column. The query groups the counted process orders by the material type text, which is indicated by 'GROUP BY 2', where '2' refers to the second selected column, i.e., 'Material Type Text'. Finally, the query sorts the results in descending order based on the count of process orders, as indicated by 'order by 1 desc', where '1' refers to the first selected column, i.e., '# Process Orders'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The given SIGNAL query is designed to count the number of process orders and group them by the material type text.
