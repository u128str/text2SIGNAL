{"signal_description": "The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'. It calculates the average cycle time, which is the difference between the last and first 'end_time' values. This average is then labeled as 'Avg. Cycle time'. The query also counts the number of 'case_id' entries and labels this count as 'No. of Cases'. Additionally, it retrieves the values from the 'PO Type' column. The results are sorted in descending order based on the first column, which is the 'Avg. Cycle time'. The query limits the output to the top 500 rows. Note that there is a commented out WHERE clause, which if active, would filter the data to only include rows where the 'EVENT_NAME' matches 'Clear Invoice' and follows the sequence 'Create PR Item' to 'Release PR Item'.", "llm_output": "{\n\"signal_description\": \"The SIGNAL query is designed to extract data from the table named 'defaultview-124'.
