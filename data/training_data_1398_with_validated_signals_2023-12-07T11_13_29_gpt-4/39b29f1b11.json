It does this by first counting the number of cases where the 'Last Invoice Due Date' is earlier than the 'Last Invoice Payment Date', indicating a late payment. This count is then divided by the total number of cases where the 'Last Invoice Payment Date' is not null, meaning a payment has been made. The result is multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage. The query also selects the 'PO Item Supplier ID' for each case.
